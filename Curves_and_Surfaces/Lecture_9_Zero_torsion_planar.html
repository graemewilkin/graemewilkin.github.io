Recall from the <a href="Lecture_8_Torsion.html">previous lecture</a> that we defined the <i>torsion</i> of a curve in terms of the <a href="Lecture_7_Frenet_Frame.html">Frenet frame</a> as follows.<br />

<br />

<b>Definition.</b> (Torsion)<br />
Let \(p : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) be a smooth regular path parametrised by arclength, and suppose that \(p(s)\) is not a point of inflection. The <i>torsion</i> is the function \(\tau(s)\) such that
\[
B'(s) = \tau(s) N(s) .
\]
Equivalently, since \(N(s)\) is a unit vector, we have
\[
\tau(s) = B'(s) \cdot N(s) .
\]

<br />

We then described the intuition behind the torsion: that it measures the change in the osculating plane of the curve. If the osculating plane is moving off its axis (more precisely: the binormal vector \(B(s)\) is moving) then we expect the torsion to be non-zero.<br />

<br />

In this lecture we will make this idea precise by proving that the torsion is zero if and only if the curve remains in a fixed plane.<br />

<br />

Recall that a plane is determine by a point \(p_0 \in \mathbb{R}^3\) and a unit normal vector \(\hat{n}\). The equation of the plane is then
\[
(p - p_0) \cdot \hat{n} = 0 .
\]
Equivalently, the vector \(p\) is on the plane if and only if \(p-p_0\) is parallel to the plane, and hence perpendicular to the normal vector.<br />

<br />

<b>Definition.</b> (Planar curve)<br />
A curve \(p : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) is <i>planar</i> if and only if it is contained in a fixed plane. Equivalently, if \(\hat{n}\) is a unit normal vector to the plane, then \(p : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R^3}\) is contained in this plane if and only if for any \(s_0 \in I\) we have
\[
\left( p(s) - p(s_0) \right) \cdot \hat{n} = 0 
\] 
for all \(s \in I\). <br />

<br />

<b>Theorem.</b><br />

If \(p : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) has no inflection points, then \(p\) is planar if and only if \(\tau(s) = 0\). <br />

<br />

<b>Proof.</b> First we show that \(p\) is planar implies that the torsion is zero.<br />

<br />

If \(p : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) is planar for a plane with normal vector \(\hat{n}\), then \(p'(s) \cdot \hat{n} = 0\) and \(p''(s) \cdot \hat{n} = 0\). Therefore, since \(p(s)\) has no inflection points, then
\[
T(s) \cdot \hat{n} = 0 \quad \text{and} \quad N(s) \cdot \hat{n} = 0 .
\]
Therefore the osculating plane spanned by \(T(s)\) and \(N(s)\) is the plane orthogonal to \(\hat{n}\), and so
\[
\begin{aligned}
B(s) & = T(s) \times N(s) = \pm \hat{n} = constant \\
\Rightarrow \quad B'(s) & = 0 \\
\Leftrightarrow \quad \tau(s) & = 0 .
\end{aligned}
\]
Therefore we have shown that \(p\) is planar implies that the torsion is zero. Conversely, now suppose that the torsion is zero. Then
\[
B'(s) = \tau(s) N(s) = 0 \quad \Leftrightarrow \quad B(s) = B(s_0) = constant.
\]
Since the Frenet frame is orthonormal, then \(0 = T(s) \cdot B(s) = T(s) \cdot B(s_0)\). Define \(\hat{n} = B(s_0) = B(s)\) for all \(s \in I\) (this makes sense since \(B(s)\) is constant), and note that
\[
\frac{d}{ds} \left( p(s) \cdot \hat{n} \right) = p'(s) \cdot B(s) = T(s) \cdot B(s) = 0
\]
Therefore \(p(s) \cdot \hat{n}\) is constant. If we fix some \(s_0 \in I\), then this implies that
\[
\begin{aligned}
p(s) \cdot \hat{n} & = p(s_0) \cdot \hat{n} \quad \text{for all \(s \in I\)} \\
\Leftrightarrow \quad \left( p(s) - p(s_0) \right) \cdot \hat{n} & = 0 \quad \text{for all \(s \in I\)} ,
\end{aligned}
\]
and so \(p : I \rightarrow \mathbb{R}^3\) is planar.<br />

<br />

Therefore we have shown that the torsion is zero implies that the curve is planar, which completes the proof. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; <code>q.e.d.</code><br />
