<br />
Now use your hyperbolic ruler and compass tools to construct the incentre and incircle of a hyperbolic triangle.<br />
 The picture below contains an example of a hyperbolic triangle PQR with incentre I. The incircle is drawn in orange. Can you construct the incentre and incircle of the triangle ABC?<br />
Once again, if you really understand Euclid's construction in Euclidean geometry then you should be able to easily do this in hyperbolic geometry using the hyperbolic line and hyperbolic circle tools that you have already constructed.<br />

<br />
To help you get a feel for what the solution should be, there is already a tool for constructing the incentre and incircle of a hyperbolic triangle. Try and construct them yourself, using only the other given tools.<br />
