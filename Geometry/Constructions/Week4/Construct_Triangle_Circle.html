In this exercise you given a triangle \(\Delta XYZ\) and a point \(R\) on the circle with centre \(P\).  Your task is to construct a triangle inscribed in this circle which is similar to the given triangle \(\Delta XYZ\) and which has one vertex at \(R\). Once you have finished the construction then you can check your answer using the angle measurement tool. You may find the <a href="Construct_Angle_Circle.html">previous exercise</a> very useful.<br /><br />
The diagram below contains an example of a triangle \(\Delta DEF\) and a triangle \(\Delta ABC\) inscribed in the given circle. You can see from the angles that \(\Delta ABC\) is similar to \(\Delta DEF\).
