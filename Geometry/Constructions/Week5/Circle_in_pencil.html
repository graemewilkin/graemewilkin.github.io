In this exercise you are given a circle centred at \(O_1\) and passing through the point \(P\). The centre \(O_1\) lies on the line \(AB\). You are also given a radical axis (coloured in red), which is perpendicular to the line \(AB\), and a line segment \(CD\). Your task is to construct a circle with centre on the line \(AB\) and radius equal to \(|CD|\) such that the red line is the radical axis of the two circles. Equivalently, you need to construct a circle with radius \(|CD|\) which is in the pencil defined by the circle centred at \(O_1\) and the red radical axis.<br /><br />
<b>Hint. </b>You should read through the different properties of the radical axis and the power of a point and see which one is the most useful here. You may find the <a href="./Construct_Hypotenuse_on_line.html">previous exercise</a> very useful.<br /><br />

The diagram below contains an example of what the solution should look like. (There are actually two circles with the required property; the diagram below only shows one of them.) You can see how the circle changes when you change the length of \(|CD|\), change the position of the radical axis by moving \(X\) along the line \(AB\), or change the original circle by moving the points \(O_1\) and \(P\).
