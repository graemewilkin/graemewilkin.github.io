The diagram above contains two circles. Given an initial point A on the outer circle, draw a tangent from A to the inner circle, and then continue until it intersects the outer circle again at a new point B. The resulting line is a chord of the outer circle which is tangent to the inner circle. Then repeat the process and draw a new chord from B which is tangent to the inner circle and intersects the outer circle again at a new point C. Repeating this process over and over produces a diagram like the one above, which contains eight of these tangential chords.<br /><br />
If the chords ever return to the point A, then the process of constructing the chords repeats itself, and the resulting figure is called a <b>Poncelet Polygon</b>.<br /><br />
Poncelet's theorem says that if a Poncelet polygon exists then it is independent of the initial point A. You can verify this by moving A around the circle or by clicking the button in the bottom left corner to animate the picture. Click and drag the points \(O_1\) and \(P_1\) to change the centre and radius of the outer circle, and move the points \(O_2\) and \(P_2\) to change the centre and radius of the inner circle. You can see that if the two circles are positioned so that the chords close up to form a Poncelet polygon, then they will do so for every choice of the initial point A on the outer circle. Conversely, if they do not close up to form a Poncelet polygon, then the same will be true for every initial point A.<br /> <br />

After experimenting with the picture above, you can see that it is difficult to get the two circles exactly right so that the chords form a perfect Poncelet polygon. If you want to construct perfect Poncelet triangles and quadrilaterals, then it is possible to use a ruler and compass to find the exact positions of the two circles. The two links below will show you how to do this. <br /><br />
