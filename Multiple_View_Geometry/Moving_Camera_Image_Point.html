<h1 align="center">What happens to an image when the camera moves along a line?</h1>

<p align="right"><a href="index.html">Back to Multiple View Geometry homepage</a></p>


<br />

The following picture shows a point \(P\) projected onto two different image planes. The black line is the camera baseline that joins the two camera centres \(C_1 C_2\), and the two epipoles \(E_1\) and \(E_2\) are the intersections of this line with the image planes.<br /><br />

You can click and drag the point \(E_2\) to move the image plane along the camera baseline \(C_1 C_2\), and the camera centre \(C_2\) will move as well.<br /><br />

Notice that the point \(Q_2\) always moves along the blue line, which is the intersection of the second image plane with the red plane (defined as the plane passing through \(P\) and the line \(C_1 C_2\)). Note that this blue line also passes through the epipolar point \(E_2\).<br /><br />

As you move the image plane by dragging the epipolar point \(E_2\) far away from \(P\), the point \(Q_2\) will move closer to \(E_2\). <br /><br />

For the case of a single point, this picture illustrates that when the camera centre moves along a line, the projection of the point on the image plane moves along a line radiating out from the epipolar point.<br /><br />

You can see an example of this the picture of a <a href="Moving_Camera_Tetrahedron.html">projection of a tetrahedron onto a moving image plane</a> and also in the following video of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IWY21GYvzVE">a camera zooming along a corridor</a>.
