<b>Past Conference Organisation.</b><br />

In August 2016 I co-organised the program <a href="http://www2.ims.nus.edu.sg/Programs/016wgeo/index.php">Geometry, Topology and Dynamics of Moduli Spaces</a> at the <a href="http://www2.ims.nus.edu.sg/">Institute for Mathematical Sciences</a> (IMS) in Singapore.<br />
 
<br />

In 2014 I co-organised the program <a href="http://www2.ims.nus.edu.sg/Programs/014geometry/index.php">The Geometry, Topology and Physics of Moduli Spaces of Higgs Bundles</a> from 7 July-29 August at the <a href="http://www2.ims.nus.edu.sg/">Institute for Mathematical Sciences</a> (IMS) in Singapore and I was on the organising committee for the <a href="http://www.icmat.es/RT/GPMODULI/">research term on the Geometry and Physics of Moduli Spaces</a> from 14 April-11 July at ICMAT in Madrid.<br />
