<h2>How do these robot solvers work?</h2>

To find an efficient solution, these robots use a Raspberry Pi running <a href="https://github.com/hkociemba/RubiksCube-TwophaseSolver">Python code</a> written by Herbert Kociemba.<br />

<br />

In mathematical language, there is a finite group acting on the cube, where each element of the group has a corresponding action on the cube given by rotating one of the faces. Each face of the cube has four possible rotations and the group is generated by all possible rotations of all faces. A solution to the cube then corresponds to finding a sequence of elements of this group. The elements of the group are written using letters, and a sequence of these is called a "word". If you read any algorithm to solve the cube, all of the steps will be written as a word using letters corresponding to the action of this group.<br />

<br />

The two phase algorithm in the code implements an algorithm that works (as the name suggests) in two phases. The first phase reduces the group to a simpler subgroup, which is generated by face rotations of 180 degrees. The second phase then solves the cube using only elements from this simpler subgroup. If you watch the video above, then towards the end (from 1:08 onwards) you can see the start of the second phase in which all the face rotations are 180 degrees.<br />

<br />

This is all explained in detail in Herbert Kociemba's <a href="http://kociemba.org/twophase.htm">description of the two phase algorithm</a><br />

<br />

As an interesting aside, you might notice that the robot has two different ways of rotating the entire cube to orient it in the right position for the next face rotation. These cube rotations (called rigid motions) generate a group called the <a href="https://maths.nuigalway.ie/~rquinlan/groups/exhibition/mcshane_obrien_thornton.pdf">octahedral group</a>, which has lots of fascinating applications to mathematical physics. You can read more about these applications in John Baez's series <a href="https://johncarlosbaez.wordpress.com/2012/05/21/symmetry-and-the-fourth-dimension-part-1/">Symmetry and the fourth dimension</a>.<br />
