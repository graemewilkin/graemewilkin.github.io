<h1 align="center">Directions to University of York Maths Department</h1>



<br />

The maths department is in James College on the west campus. You can search for the location on the <a href="http://www.york.ac.uk/np/maps/">University campus map</a> (this includes a link to an interactive campus map).<br />

The university (about 1 mile SE) and rail station (about 0.5 miles NW) are on opposite sides of the city centre.<br />

<b>Bus.</b><br />
Exit the station and catch bus #66 or #67. These buses come approximately every 10 minutes, take 17 minutes to reach the campus, and cost approximately &pound;2 for a one-way ticket (pay the driver). Exact change is not necessary, and you can use your credit card. <br />
Once the bus reaches campus, the best stop is the "University Library" stop near the first footbridge across the road. Then cross the road, walk downhill, and cross the lake.<br />

<br />

<b>Taxi.</b><br />
There is a taxi rank at the station. A taxi should cost about &pound;10 and take 10-15 minutes.<br />

<br />

<b>Walking.</b><br />
Walking to campus through the city centre takes about 40 minutes from the rail station.<br />

<br /> 

<b>Car.</b> Pay and Display parking is marked on the campus map. If you are planning to arrive by car then please contact us to arrange a visitor's permit.<br />
