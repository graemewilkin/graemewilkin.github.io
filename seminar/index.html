<b>Title.</b> (Higher) operations in topological and conformal QFTs from factorisation<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> Prefactorisation algebras (PFAs) axiomatise the algebraic structure of observables in QFTs. In the case of locally constant PFAs, which correspond to topological QFTs, I will describe how the PFA induces a (higher) algebraic structure on the gauge invariant observables of the TQFT. This involves an ordinary associative, unital product but typically also "higher" operations known as Massey products. I will also discuss the case of holomorphic PFAs in one complex dimension, which correspond to 2d CFTs, and explain how in this setting the PFA encodes the vertex algebra structure of the CFT.

<b>Title.</b> The Morse complex for semiprojective varieties<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> Moduli spaces of Higgs bundles admit a natural \(\mathbb{C}^*\) action, which makes them examples of semiprojective varieties. In the first paper on the subject, Hitchin introduced the moment map associated to the action of \(S^1 \hookrightarrow \mathbb{C}^*\) and showed that this is a perfect Morse-Bott function. In this talk I will describe the cup product on the Morse complex for both this moment map as well as <i>minus</i> the moment map. This setup applies more generally to semiprojective varieties satisfying an additional transversality condition. I will spend some time explaining the case of rank \(2\) twisted Higgs bundles, where these constructions relate to questions from classical geometry.

<b>Title.</b> The geometric Toda equations for noncompact symmetric spaces<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> Different forms of the Toda equations keep turning up both in surface theory and gauge theory. Everyone knows that they are really equations on something like the Cartan subgroup of a simple Lie group. While these have been well studied when the group is compact, the noncompact case has (surprisingly) not been given a general treatment. The aim of the talk is to explain a classification of these equations which fit the geometrical setting of minimal surfaces in noncompact symmetric spaces, and also discuss when methods from gauge theory (especially stability ideas) can be applied to provide spaces of solutions.

<b>Title.</b> Equivariant minimal surfaces in the complex hyperbolic plane<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> Over a series of three papers, two with John Loftin (Rutgers-Newark), a clear picture has emerged for the structure of the moduli space of equivariant minimal surfaces in the complex hyperbolic plane through the link with PU(2,1)-Higgs bundles. In this talk I'll give a survey of the interesting features, focussing on what we can learn about the minimal surfaces from their Higgs bundles, and some remaining open questions.

<b>Title.</b> A Lefschetz (1,1) theorem for singular varieties<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> The Lefschetz (1, 1) theorem is a classical result that tells us that for any smooth projective variety, a rational (1, 1) Hodge class comes from a algebraic cycle of codimension 1.  In 1994, Barbieri-Viale and Srinivas gave a counter-example to the obvious generalization of this result to singular varieties. Inspired by Totaro, in this talk, I will give a modification of the statement of Lefschetz (1, 1) and show that it is satisfied by several singular varieties such as those with ADE-singularities and rational singularities. In particular, this Lefschetz (1,1) statement is satisfied by the varieties considered by Barbieri-Viale and Srinivas. <br />
This is joint work with A. Dan.

<b>Title.</b> Isometric rigidity of Wasserstein spaces<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> The Wasserstein spaces over a metric space X are sets of Borel probability measures on X which are equipped with metrics derived from optimal transport.  In general, the Wasserstein spaces reflect properties of the underlying metric space X.  In this context, it is natural to ask whether the isometries of the Wasserstein space are related to those of X.  In this talk, I will discuss some work in this direction conducted together with Mauricio Che, Fernando Galaz-García and Jaime Santos-Rodríguez.

<b>Title.</b> Nonlocal estimates for volume preserving mean curvature flow<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> The volume preserving mean curvature flow (VPMCF) is the gradient flow of the area functional under the fixed enclosed volume constraint, meaning that stationary solutions of this flow are hypersurfaces of constant mean curvature. However, the non-local term in this evolution means that the flow satisfies significantly different properties to mean curvature flow and many "standard" mean curvature flow methods simply don't work. In this talk I will discuss some progress on nonlocal estimates which, amongst other things, imply that the singularities of VPMCF are in fact modelled by the (better understood) ancient solutions of mean curvature flow.<br />
This work is joint with Elena Maeder-Baumdicker.

<b>Title.</b> Zoo of dualities and related inequalities<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> In this talk, we will discuss order-reversing quasi-involutions, which are dualities on their image, and their properties. We will relate this concept to the classical example of "polarity", which corresponds to the duality between finite-dimensional normed spaces. Already this classical example incites many easy-to-formulate but difficult-to-proof questions, such as the Mahler conjecture ('39). <br />
We show that any order-reversing quasi-involution is of a special form and discuss how this unified point of view helps to deepen the understanding of the underlying structures and principles. <br />
This talk is based on joint work with Shiri Artstein-Avidan and Shay Sadovsky.

<b>Title.</b> Extracting subcomplexes in the subRiemannian setting<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> On subRiemannian manifolds, the de Rham complex is not the ideal candidate to use to carry out geometric analysis. However, special subcomplexes have successfully been applied in very specific settings, such as Heisenberg groups and the Cartan group. I will give an overview of different techniques used to obtain such subcomplexes, as well as point out their limitations when used on arbitrary Carnot groups, and a possible way to overcome them.

<b>Title.</b> Surfaces in higher-dimensional spaces and quantum integrable systems<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> Integrable systems is deeply intertwined with the geometry of surfaces. It is in this context that many of the renowned classical integrable equations – such as the sine-Gordon and the Tzizéica-Bullough-Dodd equations – first arose in the mathematical literature. A perhaps less widely known fact is the existence of a direct relation between classical and quantum integrable systems known as ODE/IM correspondence. After reviewing how the construction of minimal surfaces embedded in AdS produce classical integrable systems I will concentrate on a simple example to explicitly show the relation to quantum integrable models.
