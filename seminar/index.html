<b>Title.</b> Quantisation via differential twists<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> A universal Drinfeld twist is an inner automorphism which relate the coproduct 
of a quantum enveloping algebra to the standard coproduct of the undeformed 
enveloping algebra. In this talk I will outline the construction of a family of 
Drinfeld twists, obtained from the dynamical  Knizhnick-Zamolodchikov equations 
of a Kac-Moody algebra by exploiting their singularity at infinity. This leads to a
"transcendental" construction of quantum groups, gives a new direct proof of the 
Drinfeld-Kohno theorem, and produces in finite type a quantum dual exponential 
in the sense of Ginzburg-Weinstein. <br /><br />

<a name="yuujitanaka"><b>19 November.</b></a> <font color="green">Yuuji Tanaka</font> (Oxford)<br />
<b>Title.</b> On two generalisations of Hitchin's equations in four dimensions from Theoretical Physics<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> This talk is about two sets of gauge-theoretic equations
called Vafa-Witten and Kapustin-Witten ones, both of which have the
origin in \(N=4\) super Yang-Mills theory in Theoretical Physics. We present
them as two kinds of generalisations of Hitchin's prominent equations on
Riemann surfaces to ones in dimension four. We then discuss issues on
how to solve gauge-theoretic moduli problems for them and convey recent
progress on the problems from both analytic and algebraic aspects. <br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Symplectic duality and implosion<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Symplectic duality is a conjectured duality, arising from physics,
between certain kinds of holomorphic-symplectic or hyperkahler
manifolds. We discuss some of the issues around this duality
and present candidates for duals of implosion spaces. <br />
This is joint work with Frances Kirwan and Amihay Hanany. <br /><br />

<a name="johanmartens"><b>3 December.</b></a> <font color="green">Johan Martens</font> (Edinburgh)<br />
<b>Title.</b> A general approach to the Hitchin connection<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The Hitchin connection is a flat projective connection on bundles of non-abelian theta-functions 
over the moduli space of curves, originally introduced by Hitchin in a K&auml;hler context.  It can be understood through 
a heat operator, generalising the heat equation that (abelian) theta functions have classically been known to satisfy, 
and is also equivalent to the WZW/KZB connection in conformal field theory.  We will describe a general construction of 
this connection that also works in (most) positive characteristics.  A key ingredient is an alternative to the 
Narasimhan-Atiyah-Bott K&auml;hler form on the moduli space of bundles on a curve.  We will comment on the connection 
with some related topics, such as the Grothendieck-Katz p-curvature conjecture. <br />
This is joint work with Baier, Bolognesi and Pauly. <br /><br />

<a name="alinavdovina"><b>21 January.</b></a> <font color="green">Alina Vdovina</font> (Newcastle)<br />
<b>Title.</b> \(C^*\)-algebras coming from cube complexes and buildings<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We will give an elementary introduction to the theory of cube complexes and buildings. Then we show
how explicit geometric structures help in studying higher-rank graph \(C^*\)-algebras and their K-theory. <br /><br />

<a name="nunoromao"><b>28 January.</b></a> <font color="green">Nuno Romao</font> (Augsburg)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Pochhammer states on Riemann surfaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>  For a compact Riemann surface of genus \(g>1\), the \(L^2\)-Betti numbers (of universal or maximal abelian covers, say)
concentrate in middle degree 1, with first \(L^2\)-Betti number \(2g-2\). This reflects the fact that, on such surfaces (equipped with a 
fixed riemannian metric), nonzero harmonic \(p\)-forms valued in families of local systems, and of finite \(L^2\)-norm, only exist for \(p=1\);
in fact, there is an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of such 1-forms, with finite von Neumann dimension \(2g-2\). In my talk, I shall construct 
a complete basis for this space depending on the choice of a particular kind of pair-of-pants decomposition of the surface. We have baptised the 
elements of such a basis "Pochhammer states", since they localise to 1-cycles lifting Pochhammer curves immersed on each pair of pants, and moreover 
they span all the ground states (waveforms) in supersymmetric quantum mechanics incorporating Aharonov-Bohm phases. This construction provides 
useful geometric intuition on such a space of ground states.<br />
This is joint work with Marcel B&ouml;kstedt. <br/><br />

<b>Title.</b> Unoriented Dijkgraaf-Witten theory<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>  I will begin the talk with a basic introduction to unoriented topological field theory in low dimensions, explaining the importance of 
such theories and highlighting some open problems. I will then describe a new class of topological gauge theories, namely, unoriented twisted Dijkgraaf-Witten 
theory, and explain how computations in these theories can be understood in terms of a categorified real representation theory of finite groups.<br /><br />

<a name="mathewbullimore"><b>25 February.</b></a> <font color="green">Mathew Bullimore</font> (Durham)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Symplectic vortices and symplectic duality<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>  I will discuss moduli spaces of symplectic vortices on Riemann surfaces and associated enumerative problems arising in (supersymmetric) gauge theory. 
I will also explain how symplectic duality, a conjectural relationship between pairs of holomorphic symplectic manifolds, is reflected in highly non-trivial 
relationships between different enumerative invariants.<br /><br />

<a name="aronwall"><b>3 March.</b></a> <font color="green">Aron Wall</font> (Cambridge)<br />
<b>Title.</b> The Maximin Method: How to Prove Holographic Entropy Inequalities<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>  There are a number of interesting inequalities satisfied by minimal-area surfaces in asymptotically hyperbolic geometries. In the static version 
of AdS/CFT, these surfaces are interpreted as the entropy of the corresponding boundary regions. This relates quantum information inequalities (e.g. Strong 
Subadditivity) to geometrical inequalities which can be given simple picture-proofs.<br />

Since the dynamical version of AdS/CFT involves Lorentzian geometries, it is important to be able to prove the corresponding inequalities for asymptotically 
AdS geometries. In this case, we have to use extremal surfaces instead of globally minimal ones, making it more difficult to prove global inequalities. But 
by reformulating extremal surfaces in terms of an equivalent "maximin" variational principle, elegant proofs can be constructed. (Unlike the static case, 
these results require use of the null curvature condition.)<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Measure Contraction Property of generalised Grushin planes<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>  Synthetic notions of curvature play an important role in the study of the singular spaces where a smooth curvature bound is not available. 
The Grushin plane, a sub-Riemannian manifold, is one of these. We will look at a generalisation of the standard Grushin plane and investigate its geometry. 
A careful analysis will help us to derive distortion coefficients of the geodesic flow. Appropriate estimates will then tell us whether these spaces satisfy a 
curvature-dimension property. As a consequence, we can establish new geometric and functional inequalities, such as a Brunn-Minkowski inequality<br /><br />
