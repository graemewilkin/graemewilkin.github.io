<b>Title.</b> Quantisation via differential twists<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> A universal Drinfeld twist is an inner automorphism which relate the coproduct 
of a quantum enveloping algebra to the standard coproduct of the undeformed 
enveloping algebra. In this talk I will outline the construction of a family of 
Drinfeld twists, obtained from the dynamical  Knizhnick-Zamolodchikov equations 
of a Kac-Moody algebra by exploiting their singularity at infinity. This leads to a
"transcendental" construction of quantum groups, gives a new direct proof of the 
Drinfeld-Kohno theorem, and produces in finite type a quantum dual exponential 
in the sense of Ginzburg-Weinstein. <br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> On two generalisations of Hitchin's equations in four dimensions from Theoretical Physics<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> This talk is about two sets of gauge-theoretic equations
called Vafa-Witten and Kapustin-Witten ones, both of which have the
origin in \(N=4\) super Yang-Mills theory in Theoretical Physics. We present
them as two kinds of generalisations of Hitchin's prominent equations on
Riemann surfaces to ones in dimension four. We then discuss issues on
how to solve gauge-theoretic moduli problems for them and convey recent
progress on the problems from both analytic and algebraic aspects. <br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Symplectic duality and implosion<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Symplectic duality is a conjectured duality, arising from physics,
between certain kinds of holomorphic-symplectic or hyperkahler
manifolds. We discuss some of the issues around this duality
and present candidates for duals of implosion spaces. <br />
This is joint work with Frances Kirwan and Amihay Hanany. <br /><br />

<a name="johanmartens"><b>3 December.</b></a> <font color="green">Johan Martens</font> (Edinburgh)<br />
<b>Title.</b> A general approach to the Hitchin connection<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The Hitchin connection is a flat projective connection on bundles of non-abelian theta-functions 
over the moduli space of curves, originally introduced by Hitchin in a K&auml;hler context.  It can be understood through 
a heat operator, generalising the heat equation that (abelian) theta functions have classically been known to satisfy, 
and is also equivalent to the WZW/KZB connection in conformal field theory.  We will describe a general construction of 
this connection that also works in (most) positive characteristics.  A key ingredient is an alternative to the 
Narasimhan-Atiyah-Bott K&auml;hler form on the moduli space of bundles on a curve.  We will comment on the connection 
with some related topics, such as the Grothendieck-Katz p-curvature conjecture. <br />
This is joint work with Baier, Bolognesi and Pauly. <br /><br />

<a name="alinavdovina"><b>21 January.</b></a> <font color="green">Alina Vdovina</font> (Newcastle)<br />
<b>Title.</b> \(C^*\)-algebras coming from cube complexes and buildings<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We will give an elementary introduction to the theory of cube complexes and buildings. Then we show
how explicit geometric structures help in studying higher-rank graph \(C^*\)-algebras and their K-theory. <br /><br />

<a name="nunoromao"><b>28 January.</b></a> <font color="green">Nuno Romao</font> (Augsburg)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Pochhammer states on Riemann surfaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>  For a compact Riemann surface of genus \(g>1\), the \(L^2\)-Betti numbers (of universal or maximal abelian covers, say)
concentrate in middle degree 1, with first \(L^2\)-Betti number \(2g-2\). This reflects the fact that, on such surfaces (equipped with a 
fixed riemannian metric), nonzero harmonic \(p\)-forms valued in families of local systems, and of finite \(L^2\)-norm, only exist for \(p=1\);
in fact, there is an infinite-dimensional Hilbert space of such 1-forms, with finite von Neumann dimension \(2g-2\). In my talk, I shall construct 
a complete basis for this space depending on the choice of a particular kind of pair-of-pants decomposition of the surface. We have baptised the 
elements of such a basis "Pochhammer states", since they localise to 1-cycles lifting Pochhammer curves immersed on each pair of pants, and moreover 
they span all the ground states (waveforms) in supersymmetric quantum mechanics incorporating Aharonov-Bohm phases. This construction provides 
useful geometric intuition on such a space of ground states.<br />
This is joint work with Marcel B&ouml;kstedt. <br/><br />
