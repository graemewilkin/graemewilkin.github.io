<b>Title.</b> The energy of holomorphic sections of the Deligne-Hitchin moduli space<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
The aim of the talk is to introduce a natural functional on the space of holomorphic sections of  the twistor spaces of a class of hyper-K&auml;hler manifolds, including the Hitchin moduli spaces.<br /> 

In the first part, we recall basic concepts of hyper-K&auml;hler manifolds and their twistor spaces. For hyper-K&auml;hler spaces admitting a circle action (and some additional conditions) we explain the construction (by Haydys and Hitchin) of a holomorphic line bundle with a meromorphic connection on its twistor space. The energy of a section is given by the residue of the pull-back of the meromorphic connection. It is shown that the energy on the spaces of twistor lines  coincides with the moment map for the circle action. In the second part of the talk we consider the particular case of the Higgs bundle moduli space. Its twistor space can be identified with the Deligne-Hitchin moduli space of \(\lambda\)-connections. We prove a natural formula for the energy of a section of the Deligne-Hitchin moduli spaces in terms of a Serre-type pairing. Finally, we compute the energy for a class of examples given by Willmore surface.<br />
 The talk is based on joint work with F. Beck and M. R&ouml;ser, and on joint work with L. Heller.

<b>Title.</b> Poisson structures on moduli spaces of Higgs bundles over stacky curves<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
For a connected complex reductive group \(G\), the \(G\)-character varieties over a complex algebraic curve consist a much studied class of Poisson manifolds. Under the non-abelian Hodge correspondence such character varieties correspond to appropriate algebro-geometric quotients, over which one can study the construction of certain Poisson structures from a rather algebraic point of view. In this talk, we shall discuss a certain construction via Atiyah algebroids for the moduli spaces of Higgs bundles over stacky curves.<br />
This is joint work with Hao Sun and Lutian Zhao.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Compactifcations of Hermitian-Yang-Mills moduli space and the Yang-Mills flow on projective manifold<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
One of the cornerstones of gauge theory and complex geometry in the late 20th century was the so-called "Kobayashi-Hitchin correspondence", which provides a link between Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections (gauge theory) and stable holomorphic structures (complex geometry) on a vector bundle over projective (or merely K&auml;hler) manifold. On the one hand, this gives an identification of (non-compact) moduli spaces. On the other, one proof of the correspondence goes through a natural parabolic (up to gauge) flow called Yang-Mills flow. Namely, Donaldson proved the convergence of this flow to an Hermitian-Yang-Mills connection in the case that the initial holomorphic structure is stable. Two questions that this leaves open are: 1. Do the moduli spaces admit compactifications, and if so what sort of structure do they have? Are they for example complex spaces? Complex projective? What is the relationship between the compactifications on each side? 2. What is the behaviour of the flow at infinity in the case when the initial holomorphic structure is unstable? I will touch on aspects of my previous work on these problems and explain how they connect up with each other. <br />
This work is spread out over several papers, and is partly joint work with Richard Wentworth, and with Daniel Greb, Matei Toma, and Richard Wentworth.

<b>Title.</b> Virtual Morse-Bott theory on analytic spaces, moduli spaces of SO(3) monopoles, and applications to four-manifolds<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> 
We introduce an approach to Morse-Bott theory, called virtual Morse-Bott theory, for Hamiltonian functions of circle actions on closed, real analytic, almost Hermitian spaces. In the case of Hamiltonian functions of circle actions on closed, smooth, almost K&auml;hler (symplectic) manifolds, virtual Morse-Bott theory coincides with classical Morse-Bott theory due to Bott (1954) and Frankel (1959). We prove that positivity of virtual Morse-Bott indices implies downward gradient flow in the top stratum of smooth points in the analytic space. When applied to moduli spaces of Higgs pairs on a smooth Hermitian vector bundle over a Riemann surface of genus two or more, virtual Morse-Bott theory allows one to relax assumptions due to Hitchin (1987) that ensure that those moduli spaces are smooth, for example, that the degree and rank of the vector bundle are coprime and hence that the defining Higgs equations for Higgs pairs are unobstructed in the sense of Kuranishi (1965) and that gauge transformations act freely. We apply our method to the moduli space of SO(3) monopoles over a complex, K&auml;hler surface, use the Atiyah-Singer Index Theorem to compute virtual Morse-Bott indices of all critical strata (Seiberg-Witten moduli subspaces), and prove that these indices are positive in a setting with implications for the geography of closed, smooth four-manifolds of Seiberg-Witten simple type.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Area Estimates for High genus Lawson surfaces via DPW<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
Starting at a saddle tower surface, we give a new existence proof of the Lawson surfaces \(\xi_{m,k}\) of high genus by dropping some closing conditions of the surface and then deforming the corresponding DPW potential. As a byproduct, we obtain for fixed m estimates on the area of \(\xi_{m,k}\) in terms of their genus \(g= mk \gg 1\)<br />

This is joint work with Sebastian Heller and Martin Traizet.

<b>Title.</b> Deformed \(G_2\)-instantons<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> Deformed \(G_2\)-instantons are special connections occurring in \(G_2\) geometry in 7 dimensions.  They arise as “mirrors” to certain calibrated cycles, providing an analogue to deformed Hermitian-Yang-Mills connections, and are critical points of a Chern-Simons-type functional.  I will describe an elementary construction of the first non-trivial examples of deformed \(G_2\)-instantons, and their relation to 3-Sasakian geometry, nearly parallel \(G_2\)-structures, isometric \(G_2\)-structures, obstructions in deformation theory, the topology of the moduli space, and the Chern-Simons-type functional.

<b>Title.</b> Moduli spaces for unstable Higgs bundles of rank 2 and their geometry<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> The moduli space of semistable Higgs bundles of arbitrary rank and degree on a nonsingular projective curve was first constructed by Nitsure in 1990, using Geometric Invariant Theory (GIT). Thanks to its rich geometric structure, this moduli space continues to represent an active area of research. The aim of this talk is to describe how recent results in Non-Reductive GIT can be used to construct moduli spaces for Higgs bundles which are not semistable, and to describe initial steps towards the study of their geometry in the rank 2 case.
