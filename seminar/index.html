<b>Title.</b> \(G_2\) instantons bubbling at infinity on \(S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^4\)<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
In this talk, we will discuss two sorts of bubbling for Yang-Mills instantons on a \(G_2\)-manifold, with some explicit examples arising from solutions to an ODE. The first describes bubbling off instantons on a fixed asymptotic model space, in this case, the asymptotic cone of the Bryant-Salamon \(S^3 \times \mathbb{R}^4\). The second describes the limiting behaviour of instantons as one varies the asymptotic geometry in family of Taub-NUT-type metrics.<br />
 This is joint work with Matt Turner (Bath). <br />

<b>Title.</b> Topology and geometry of 3-dimensional Alexandrov spaces<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
Alexandrov spaces (with curvature bounded below) are metric generalizations of complete Riemannian manifolds with a uniform lower sectional curvature bound. Instances of Alexandrov spaces include compact Riemannian orbifolds and orbit spaces of isometric compact Lie group actions on compact Riemannian manifolds. In addition to being objects of intrinsic interest, Alexandrov spaces play an important role in Riemannian geometry, for example, in Perelman's proof of the Poincaré Conjecture. In this talk, I will discuss the topology and geometry of 3-dimensional Alexandrov spaces, focusing on their classification and structure under certain geometric constraints (for example, positive or non-negative curvature and collapse).<br />

<b>Title.</b> The universal structure of moment maps in complex geometry<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
Much of complex geometry is motivated by linking the existence of solutions to geometric PDEs (producing "canonical metrics") to stability conditions in algebraic geometry. I will address a more basic question: what is the recipe to produce geometric PDEs in complex geometry? The solution to this will use some old tools from symplectic geometry, namely equivariant differential geometry and the theory of moment maps (though I will not assume any prior knowledge of complex or symplectic geometry). <br />
This is joint work with Michael Hallam.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Instantons on Asymptotically Conical Spin(7)-Manifolds<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
In this talk we discuss instantons on asymptotically conical Spin(7)-manifolds where the instanton is asymptotic to a fixed nearly G2-instanton at infinity. In particular, we focus on the deformation theory of these instantons; by relating the deformation complex with spinors, we identify the space of infinitesimal deformations with the kernel of the twisted negative Dirac operator on the asymptotically conical Spin(7)-manifold.

Finally, we apply this theory to describe the deformations of Fairlie-Nuyts-Fubini-Nicolai (FNFN) Spin(7)-instantons on \(\mathbb{R}^8\). We calculate the virtual dimension of the moduli space using Atiyah-Patodi-Singer index theorem and the spectrum of the twisted Dirac operator.

<b>Title.</b> A Chern-Simons Theory for the North Atlantic Ocean<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
In 1922, Richardson published a remarkable book in which he documented his failure to predict the weather six hours in advance. He was missing two of the most important breakthroughs of 20th century science: computers, and low-energy effective field theory. In this talk, I’ll revisit the equations that Richardson studied and show that they can be recast as a gauge theory in d=2+1 dimensions. In a particular limit, this gauge theory becomes Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory and describes a class of waves in the ocean and atmosphere. Chern-Simons theory is well known to exhibit edge modes, and these have been observed in quantum Hall states. These same edge modes also manifest themselves as chiral waves in the ocean that run along the coast.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Stratifications on the nilpotent cone of the moduli space of Hitchin pairs<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
We consider the problem of finding the limit at infinity (corresponding to the downward Morse flow) of a Higgs bundle in the nilpotent cone under the natural \(\mathbb{C}^*\)-action on the moduli space. For general rank we provide an answer for Higgs bundles with regular nilpotent Higgs field, while in rank three we give the complete answer. Our results show that the limit can be described in terms of data defined by the Higgs field, via a filtration of the underlying vector bundle.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Hodge bundles of length two in the moduli space of Higgs bundles<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
The geometry of the moduli space of Higgs bundles is governed by the so called global nilpotent cone. This is the  fibre over 0 of the Hitchin map, sending a Higgs bundle to its characteristic polynomial. A particularly important subset of the nilpotent cone is given by fixed points of a \(\mathbb{C}^*\)action, also called systems of Hodge bundles. Indeed, these determine important geometric information, such as the irreducible components of the nilpotent cone, and in the cases where very stable points exist,  their multiplicity, as proven by Hausel and Hitchin. These two authors identified some potential obstructions to the existence of very stable points, in terms of the polynomiality of some invariants (virtual equivariant multiplicites, and equivariant Euler classes). In this talk, I will analyse the case of nilpotent order two fixed points, showing that, except for one case, they never contain very stable points, and contrast these results with the computation of the afore mentioned invariants.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Fokas Diagonalization<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
We describe a new form of diagonalization for linear two point constant coefficient differential operators with arbitrary linear boundary conditions. Although the diagonalization is in a weaker sense than that usually employed to solve initial boundary value problems (IBVP), we show that it is sufficient to solve IBVP whose spatial parts are described by such operators. We argue that the method described may be viewed as a reimplementation of the Fokas transform method for linear evolution equations on the finite interval. The results are extended to multipoint and interface operators, including operators defined on networks of finite intervals, in which the coefficients of the differential operator may vary between subintervals, and arbitrary interface and boundary conditions may be imposed; differential operators with piecewise constant coefficients are thus included.<br />

<b>Title.</b> The measure contraction property in the sub-Finsler Heisenberg group<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
The Heisenberg group is a source of inspiration for many fields in mathematics and physics, including quantum theory, metric geometry, and harmonic analysis. I will discuss the sub-Finsler geometry of the Heisenberg group and explain how it is related to the isoperimetric problem in the non-Euclidean (Finsler) plane. We will then explore approaches to studying the curvature of the sub-Finsler Heisenberg group, focusing particularly on the measure contraction property that appears in the analysis of metric measure spaces.<br />
This is a joint work with Kenshiro Tashiro, Mattia Magnabosco, and Tommaso Rossi.

<b>Title.</b> Hyper-K&auml;hler moduli spaces of monopoles with arbitrary symmetry breaking<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
Monopoles are solutions to the gauge-theoretic Bogomolny equations, a set of PDEs closely related to the anti-self-dual Yang-Mills equations. For the gauge group \(SU(2)\) they have been studied extensively, where they have been shown to form complete hyper-K&auml;hler moduli spaces. For other gauge groups not so much is known, especially in the case of non-maximal symmetry breaking, a condition on their asymptotic behaviour. In this talk we present a construction of the moduli spaces for arbitrary gauge group and symmetry breaking, which furthermore provides them with a hyper-K&auml;hler metric.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Fock bundles and Teichm&uuml;ller spaces<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
Higher Teichm&uuml;ller theory is concerned with the study of special connected components of character varieties sharing analogous properties to the classical Teichm&uuml;ller space. Fixing a complex structure on the underlying topological surface introduces powerful holomorphic techniques through certain holomorphic pairs called Higgs bundles, which correspond to fundamental group representations via the non-abelian Hodge correspondence. Yet, a rather adverse aspect of the correspondence is that is fails to transfer the action of the mapping class group on character varieties to the moduli space of Higgs bundles.<br />

We will introduce a similar class of augmented bundles over a topological surface that we call Fock bundles which does not require fixing any complex structure on the underlying surface. We conjecture that there is an alternative passage to the one given by the non-abelian Hodge correspondence from such pairs to certain higher rank Teichm&uuml;ller spaces that is independent of the complex structure on the surface.<br />

This is joint work with Charles Reid (Austin) and Alexander Thomas (Heidelberg).<br />

<b>Title.</b> A compact and non-convex ancient solution to curve shortening flow<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
Understanding ancient solutions is a central problem in the study of geometric flows, which in the case of curve shortening flow (CSF) has seen significant recent progress. This includes the classification of compact, convex ancient solutions to CSF by P. Daskalopoulos, R. Hamilton, and N. Sesum. In this talk, we discuss the construction of a non-convex ancient solution to CSF which is at all times compact and embedded, which shows that the convexity assumption cannot be dropped in the D-H-S classification.<br />
This talk is based on joint work with S. Angenent, C. Olson, and Y. Zhang.<br />
