<b>Title.</b> Cyclic monopole chains and parabolic Higgs bundles<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
Monopoles are solutions of a natural gauge theoretical equation on a three-manifold.  Under favourable conditions, they are an integrable system and form hyperkaehler moduli spaces.  Much of the work on monopoles to date has focussed on the simplest possible base manifold, namely \(\mathbb{R}^3\).  In this talk we instead discuss monopoles on \(\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1\), aka "monopole chains".  By a result of Cherkis and Kapustin, these are naturally dual to Higgs bundles on a cylinder.  A problem that has received a lot of attention in both the monopole and Higgs bundle literature is the construction of symmetric solutions; in this talk I will describe one such result, namely a classification of monopole chains invariant under actions of cyclic symmetries.

<b>Title.</b> Generalized Character Varieties and Quantization via Factorization Homology<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
Factorization homology is a local-to-global invariant which "integrates" disk algebras in symmetric monoidal higher categories over manifolds. In this talk we will focus on a particular instance of factorization homology on surfaces where the input algebraic data is a braided monoidal category. If one takes the representation category of a quantum group as an input, it was shown by Ben-Zvi, Brochier and Jordan (BZBJ) that categorical factorization homology quantizes the category of quasi-coherent sheaves on the moduli space of G-local systems. In this talk I will present two applications of the factorization homology approach for quantizing (generalized) character varieties. In a first part I will explain how to compute categorical factorization homology on surfaces with principal D-bundles decorations, for D a finite group. The main example for us comes from an action of Dynkin diagram automorphisms on representation categories of quantum groups. We will see that in this case factorization homology gives rise to a  quantization of Out(G)-twisted G-character varieties (This is based on joint work with Lukas M&uuml;ller). In a second part we will allow for surfaces with certain stratifications, namely marked points. It was shown by BZBJ that the algebraic data governing marked points are braided module categories and I will discuss an example related the theory of dynamical quantum groups.

<b>Title.</b> Bow Construction of Yang-Mills Instantons on Taub-NUT space<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
We describe the relationship between bows and instantons.  The bows give a complete construction of all instantons (with assumption of regular asymptotic holonomy).  We illustrate how it can be used to study both instantons and their moduli spaces.

<b>Title.</b> Anti-self-dual instantons and codimension-1 collapse<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
We study the behaviour of anti-self-dual instantons on \(\mathbb{R}^3 \times S^1\) (also known as calorons) under codimension-1 collapse, i.e. when the circle factor shrinks to zero length. In this limit, the instanton equation reduces to the well-known Bogomolny equation of magnetic monopoles on \(\mathbb{R}^3\). However, inspired by work of Kraan and van Baal in the mathematical physics literature, we show how \(SU(2)\) instantons can be realised as superpositions of monopoles and "rotated monopoles" glued into a singular background abelian configuration consisting of Dirac monopoles of positive and negative charges. If time permits, I will also discuss potential applications of this construction to moduli spaces of instantons on more general ALF spaces. <br />
This is joint work with Calum Ross.

<b>Title.</b> Proof of the Toponogov Conjecture on Complete Surfaces<br />

<b>Abstract.</b> 
We prove a conjecture of Toponogov on complete convex surfaces, namely that such surfaces must contain an umbilic point, albeit at infinity. Our proof is indirect. It uses Fredholm regularity of an associated Riemann-Hilbert boundary value problem and an existence result for holomorphic discs with Lagrangian boundary conditions, both of which apply to a putative counterexample. Corollaries of the main theorem include a Hawking-Penrose singularity-type theorem, as well as the proof of a conjecture of Milnor's from 1965 in the convex case.  <br />
This is joint work with Brendan Guilfoyle.
