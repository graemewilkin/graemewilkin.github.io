<b>Title.</b> The Goldman symplectic form on the Hitchin component<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Let S be a closed, orientable, connected surface of genus at least 2. We prove that any ideal triangulation on S determines a symplectic trivialization (with respect to the Goldman symplectic form) of the tangent bundle of the Hitchin component. One can then consider the parallel flows with respect to the flat structure given by this trivialization. We give a geometric description of all such flows in terms of explicit deformations of Frenet curves, and prove that all such flows are Hamiltonian. Applying this to a particular ideal triangulation allows us to find a maximal family of Poisson commuting Hamiltonian flows on the Hitchin component. This generalizes the well-known fact that on Teichm&uuml;ller space, the twist flows along a pants decomposition of S is a maximal family of Poisson commuting Hamiltonian flows. <br />
This is joint work with Zhe Sun and Anna Wienhard. <br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Algebra, geometry, and topology of groups \(G_{n}^{k}\)<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> If dynamical systems describing motion of \(n\) particles possessing a natural codimension 1 property governed by exactly \(k\) particles, then they have topological invariants valued in groups \(G_{n}^{k}\).<br />
 
We shall discuss various aspects of this approach in<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 1) Topology: how to study homotopy groups of configuration spaces (braids etc)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 2) Algebra (word problem, conjugacy problem, relation to Coxeter groups and other groups)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 3) Geometry (relation to smooth structures)<br />
&nbsp; &nbsp; 4) Algebraic geometry (hierarchy of families of algebraic curves)<br />
and other sciences.

<b>Lecture Series.</b> <font color="green">Vassily Manturov</font> (Moscow State Technical University)<br /><br />
<a name="manturovlecture1"><b>Lecture 1. </b></a>Braid groups and groups \(G_{n}^{k}\)<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will talk on two main examples mapping the pure braid group \(PB_{n}\) to \(G_{n}^{3}\) and to \(G_{n}^{4}\) and discuss the origins of the \(G_{n}^{k}\) theory.<br />
 
I will also discuss projective duality and situations when particles are not 
necessary points. 
<br /><br />

<a name="manturovlecture2"><b>Lecture 2. </b></a>Groups \(G_{n}^{k}\), recognition problems and relation to other groups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will describe the algebraic methods of <i>rewriting</i>, which allows one to relate the groups \(G_{n}^{k}\). I will speak on the solution of word and conjugacy problems for specific \(n\), \(k\). I will especially concentrate on the groups \(G_{k+1}^{k}\) which are isomorphic to fundamental groups of concrete configuration spaces.
<br /><br />

<a name="manturovlecture3"><b>Lecture 3. </b></a>Groups \(G_{n}^{k}\), geometry, and close relatives of \(G_{n}^{k}\)<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will concentrate on several variations of the \(G_{n}^{k}\) approach leading to other grous depending on geometry. I will also give a list of unsolved problems and research projects.

<b>Title.</b> Primitive stable representations in higher rank symmetric spaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We study primitive stable representations of free groups into higher rank semisimple Lie groups and their properties. Let \(\Sigma\) be a compact, connected, orientable surface (possibly with boundary) of negative Euler characteristic. We first verify the regularity for convex projective structures and positive representations. Then we show that the holonomies of convex projective structures and positive representations on \(\Sigma\) are all primitive stable if \(\Sigma\) has one boundary component.<br />

This is a joint work with Inkang Kim.

<a name="ingridirmer"><b>2 February.</b></a> <font color="green">Ingrid Irmer</font> (Technion)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Surface subgroups of 3-manifold groups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Commutator length is a group theoretical analogue of genus. By taking a limit, <i>stable commutator length</i>, \(scl\), is obtained. This is a group invariant that can be studied topologically. As \(scl\) detects surface subgroups, it is thought to be an important invariant invariant for the study of 3-manifolds, however, there are open questions regarding its computability and its unit norm ball. This talk will give some background on \(scl\) in low dimensional topology, and will outline some work in progress of the speaker towards resolving these questions for 3-manifold groups. 
<br /><br />

<a name="wongliangze"><b>6 February.</b></a> <font color="green">Wong Liang Ze</font> (University of Washington)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Homotopy Type Theory and the Internal Language Conjectures<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Homotopy Type Theory is a relatively recent approach to abstract homotopy theory. In this largely expository talk, I will introduce homotopy type theory and its relation to other approaches such as Joyal and Lurie's  -categories, Brown's categories of fibrant objects and Shulman's type-theoretic fibration categories. I will end by presenting some recent progress towards proving the Internal Language Conjectures, which state that homotopy type theory provides a language in which to reason about these other categories.<br />
This is joint work with Simon Cho, Cory Knapp and Clive Newstead. 
<br /><br />

<a name="clementguerin"><b>7 February.</b></a> <font color="green">Clement Guerin</font> (Luxembourg)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Coordinates of character varieties<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In this talk, I will explain how to compute coordinates and equations of some character varieties from a finitely generated group to some complex simple algebraic groups. It boils down to the computation of invariant functions on representation varieties. While finding a generating family of these functions is a classical problem (mostly trace functions), narrowing it down to a finite set of generators (which exists because of GIT) appears to be a difficult problem. Getting the equations of the character varieties is also a difficult problem. There exist, beyond the definition, methods to compute them when \(G\) is a small algebraic group (\(SL_2\), \(GL_2\) or \(PGL_2\)). I will review them and some examples as well. If time permits, I will expand on some open questions related to this topic.

<a name="fabriziobianchi"><b>14 February.</b></a> <font color="green">Fabrizio Bianchi</font> (Imperial College)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Dynamical stability in one and several complex variables<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In this talk we discuss stability of holomorphic dynamical systems under perturbation. In dimension 1, the theory is now classical and is based on works by Lyubich, Man&eacute;-Sad-Sullivan and DeMarco. I will review this theory and present a recent generalisation valid in any dimension. Since classical 1-dimensional techniques no longer apply in higher dimensions, our approach is based on ergodic and pluripotential methods.

<a name="olivierglorieux"><b>21 February.</b></a> <font color="green">Olivier Glorieux</font> (Luxembourg)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Random triangles on compact surfaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The study of random triangles has started with a "pillow" question of C. Dogson in 1893. The original problem is to know the probability for a triangle to be acute or not. This is not a well defined problem since there are no invariant probabilities on \(\mathbb{R}^2\). However, considering different probability measures, Portnoy proposed a few solutions in 1994.<br /> 
With A. Yarmola from University of Luxembourg, we look at random triangles on compact surfaces, where the Lebesgue measure is a canonical choice of probability measure.  We answer the following problem: what is the probability for a triangle to be homotopically trivial on euclidean tori? We also give some constructions to understand the behaviour of this probability on the moduli space as the genus grows to infinity.

<a name="antonalekseev"><b>1 March.</b></a> <font color="green">Anton Alekseev</font> (Universit&eacute; de Gen&egrave;ve)<br />
<b>Title.</b> The Kashiwara-Vergne theory<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The Kashiwara-Vergne (KV) problem is a property of the Baker-Campbell-Hausdorff series \(\log(e^xe^y) = x + y + 1/2 [x,y] + \cdots\) which was conjectured in 1978. It was designed as a tool of proving the Duflo theorem on the isomorphism between the center of the universal enveloping algebra and the ring of invariant polynomials.<br /> 

The KV problem originates in Lie theory but it is related to many fields of Mathematics. Its proof uses braid groups and the theory of Drinfeld associators, and there is an interaction between the KV problem and the theory of  multiple zeta values in number theory. It was recently discovered that the there is a surprising link between the KV problem and Goldman brackets and Turaev cobrackets on spaces of homotopy classes of free loops on surfaces.<br />

In the talk, we will explain (some of) the notions and results mentioned above. It is designed as a gentle introduction into the topic. The talk is based on joint works with B. Enriquez, N. Kawazumi, Y. Kuno, E. Meinrenken, F. Naef and C. Torossian.

<a name="jingangxiong"><b>15 March.</b></a> <font color="green">Jingang Xiong</font> (Beijing Normal University)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Recent developments on the Nirenberg problem<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In 1969--1970, L. Nirenberg raised the problem: Which function \(K\) is the Gaussian or Scalar curvature of a conformal metric to the standard one on the unit sphere? This problem is equivalent to solving a critical elliptic equation with variational structure. Tremendous progresses have been made over the 50 years. I will give a brief review of classical results on Nirenberg Problem and also results on analogues for Q curvatures. I will present my joint work with Tianling Jin and Yanyan Li, which gives a unified approach to those results and provides solutions of Nirenberg type problems of higher or fractional orders. A new major input is the blow up analysis via Green's representation.
<br /><br />

<a name="gaetanborot"><b>29 March.</b></a> <font color="green">Gaetan Borot</font> (Max Planck Institute)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Geometric Recursion<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will present a general formalism, called "geometric recursion", which constructs functorial assignments from a category of surfaces \(Surf\). It takes as input a functor \(E : Surf \rightarrow C\) to a certain category \(C\) of topological vector spaces together with morphisms representing union and glueing operations, and a few initial data in \(E(P)\) and \(E(T)\) -- where \(P\) and \(T\) are pair of pants and tori with one boundary. The output \(W_{S} \in E(S)\) is called "amplitude" and is defined by induction, summing over all ways of excising homotopy class of pairs of pants from \(S\) and glueing amplitudes for the resulting pieces of greater Euler characteristic. This construction refines (and identifies the geometric meaning of) the topological recursion of Eynard and Orantin which has appeared in many areas of enumerative geometry and mathematical physics.<br />

For instance, \(E(S)\) can be various spaces of functions, forms, sections of bundles, etc. over the Teichmuller space of \(S\). We will give a few examples in relation with Mirzakhani-McShane identities, intersection theory on Deligne-Mumford moduli space of curves, and if time permits, geometric structures on the moduli space of flat connections.<br />

This is a joint work with J.E. Andersen and N. Orantin.

<a name="haigangli"><b>2 May.</b></a> <font color="green">Haigang Li</font> (Beijing Normal University)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Babuska problem in composite material<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We study a class of second order elliptic equations and systems of divergence form, with discontinuous coefficients, arising from the study of composite materials.  For the original problem proposed by Ivo Babuska concerning the system of linear elasticity, we develop an iteration technique with respect to the energy integral to overcome the difficulty from the lack of maximal principle and obtain the optimal blow-up rates of the gradients when two inclusions are close to touch. Our results hold for convex inclusions with arbitrary shape and in all dimensions. For the scalar case, we further establish an explicit dependence of the derivatives on the ellipticity coefficients and the distance between interfacial boundaries of inclusions, which unifies the known results in the literature and answers two open problems proposed by Li-Vogelius (ARMA2000).<br />
This is based on a series of joint work with Professor Jiguang Bao(BNU), Yanyan Li(Rutgers) et al.
