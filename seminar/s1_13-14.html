<b>Title.</b> Totally geodesic surfaces and quadratic forms<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
Let \(M\) be a compact, connected, irreducible oriented \(3\)-manifold with torus boundary. A closed, orientable, immersed, incompressible surface \(F\) in \(M\) with no incompressible annulus joining \(F\) and \(\partial M\) compresses in at most finitely many Dehn fillings \(M(\alpha)\). It is known that there is no universal upper bound on the number of such fillings, independent of the surface, and the figure eight knot complement is the first example of a manifold where this phenomenon occurs. In this paper, we show that the same behaviour of the figure eight knot complement is shared by other two cusped manifolds.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Board games and the fixed point theorem<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
We are going to present a proof of the famous Brouwer Fixed Point Theorem that uses determinacy of a certain type of board games. The talk is a refined version of David Gale's proof published in 1979. We are not going to get into any technical details, keeping the level of the talk quite low, even available to students who just entered the university.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Moment map flows and the Hecke correspondence for quivers<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
In a series of papers, Nakajima uses quiver varieties to give a geometric construction of representations of affine Kac-Moody algebras and quantum affine algebras. The generators of these algebras are constructed using the Hecke correspondence. In this talk I will give an introduction to quiver varieties and show how to construct the Hecke correspondence using the gradient flow of the norm-square of a moment map.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Killer intervals and Hurwitz constants for pseudomodular groups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
A continuation of the discussion of the paper "Pseudomodular surfaces" by Long and Reid. There are a number of open questions and this talk will focus on the killer intervals and Hurwitz numbers.<br /><br />

<b>Title. </b>Stable length and the Chillingworth class<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
The Torelli group is the subgroup of the mapping class group that acts trivially on homology. One of the most fundamental structures on the Torelli group is the Johnson homomorphism. In this talk it will be shown that a contraction of the Johnson homomorphism, the so-called "Chillingworth class", can be understood as a signed stable length on a family of curve complexes.<br /><br />

<b>Title. </b>Decomposition and exponent problem in homotopy theory<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
It is extremely difficult to compute the torsion part of the homotopy groups of a topological space. Considering this we turn to estimate the torsion parts by giving a bound for their exponents, namely, homotopy exponents. In this talk I will introduce the method of homotopy decomposition to show how to obtain upper bounds for the homotopy exponents of some homogeneous spaces.

<b>Title. </b>The outer automorphism group of SL_p(R)<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
In this talk, we are going to discuss the outer automorphism group of the special linear group over certain rings, motivated by similar results from geometric group theory.

<b>Title. </b>Several kinds of distances on curve complexes of surfaces and some applications to Heegaard splittings<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
Let \(S\) be a closed connected orientable surface of genus \(g\geq 2\). The curve complex \(C(S)\) is defined as follows: It has as its vertices the isotopy classes of essential simple closed curves. Distinct vertices \(v_0, v_1,\cdots , v_q\) determine a \(q\)-simplex of \(C(S)\) if they can be represented by \(q\) pairwise disjoint simple closed curves on \(S\). It is known that \(C(S)\) is connected. The complex \(C(S)\) can be made into a complete, geodesic metric space by making each simplex into a regular Euclidean simplex of side length 1, where the distance between two vertices is defined to be the minimal length of the edge-paths from one vertex to the another in the complex. In the present talk, I will introduce two kinds of distances on the \(C(S)\): one is the \(i\)-distance of two \(i\)-simplices in \(C(S)\), for \(0\leq i\leq 3g-4\), which is a generalization of the usual distance of \(C(S)\); the other one is the \(S\)-distance of two vertices in \(C(S)\), which is defined as follows. An \(S\)-path between two non-separating curves \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\) is a sequence of curves \(\alpha=\alpha_{0}, \alpha_{1},...,\alpha_{m}=\beta\) on \(S\) such that \(\alpha_{i-1}\) intersects \(\alpha_{i}\) transversely in a single point for \(1\leq i\leq m\). \(m\) is called the length of the \(S\)-path. The \(S\)-distance of  \(\alpha\) and \(\beta\), denoted by \(s(\alpha,\beta)\), is the minimal length of all \(s\)-paths from \(\alpha\) to \(\beta\). We will show some fundamental properties of these distances, and discuss some applications to Heegaard splittings, including an alternative proof of the well-known Lickorish-Wallace Theorem which says that any closed orientable 3-manifold can be obtained by doing surgery along a link in the 3-sphere.<br /><br />

<b>Title. </b>The differential fundamental group scheme<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
The problem originates from Hilbert's 21st Problem and Tannakian duality. The category of flat connections on a smooth complex variety is an abelian tensor category. Tannaka duality applied to the fiber functor at a point of the variety yields an affine group scheme called the differential group scheme of the given variety. The analogous question in positive characteristic has been studied by Grothendieck, Katz and Gieseker in the 70s. Flat connection is replaced by stratified bundle. In recent years the subject has drawn attention of many authors, for instance dos Santos, Esnault, Mehta, Kindler,... The aim of this talk is too report recent progress on the structure of the differential fundamental group and to discuss some open questions.

<b>Title. </b><br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
This is joint work with Avishy Carmi. We model fusion of information in mutually interacted processes using networks of embedded spheres and labeled ('coloured') line-segments in \(\mathbb{R}^4\). Topological invariants of these embedded coloured objects, which we call `tangle machines', capture information-theoretical quantities associated to the phenomena that we are modeling. An advantage of this approach is that it allows us to simplify a description of such a network by ambient isotopy, preserving its information content, before performing an explicit information theoretical computation.<br />
 
In this talk, I will introduce tangle machines, discuss their topological invariants, and suggest some real-world applications.

<b>Title. </b>Examples of quasitoric manifolds as special unitary manifolds<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
In this talk, we shall show that for each \(n\geq 5\) with only \(n\neq 6\), there exists a \(2n\)-dimensional specially omnioriented quasitoric manifold M^{2n} which represents a nonzero element in the unitary bordism ring \(\Omega^U_*\). This provides counterexamples for the Buchstaber-Panov-Ray conjecture. (Joint work with Wei Wang).

<b>Title. </b>Whitney Functions, the real homotopy type of a semi-analytic set, and a Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg type theorem<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
In the talk we consider semi-analytic subsets of a real analytic manifold and their homology and real homotopy type. It is well-known that de Rham's Theorem does not hold true in general for singular spaces such as semi-analytic sets. We show that to remedy this one can replace the de Rham complex by the Whitney-de Rham complex to compute the singular homology of such sets. Beyond that, the Whitney-deRham complex even determines the real homotopy type of a semi-analytic set which extends a result by Sullivan for the de Rham complex on smooth manifolds. Finally, we comment on a Hochschild-Kostant-Rosenberg type theorem for Whitney functions. <br />
The talk is based on joint work with B. Chriestenson and J.-P. Brasselet.

<b>Title. </b>Schubert calculus and the cohomology of Lie groups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
The problem of determining the cohomology of Lie groups was raised by E. Cartan in 1929 and has been a focus of algebraic topology for the fundamental roles of Lie groups playing in geometry and topology. On the other hand Schubert calculus began with the intersection theory of the 19th century. Clarifying this calculus was a major theme of 20th century algebraic geometry. We bring a connection between these two topics both with distinguished historical backgrounds, and demonstrate how Schubert calculus is extended as to give an explicit and unified construction of the integral cohomology rings of all compact and 1-connected Lie groups.<br /><br />

<b>Title. </b>Classical and non-classical subgroups of Schottky groups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b>
Schottky groups are the free Kleinian groups without parabolic elements, given by a geometric construction of pairing curves in the Riemann sphere.  Schottky groups come in two flavors: classical Schottky groups, in which the curves are circles in the Riemann sphere, and non-classical Schottky groups.  It is a theorem of Marden that non-classical Schottky groups exist.  In this talk, we will consider the extent to which being classical or non-classical are hereditary.  We will show that both finite and infinite index subgroups of classical Schottky groups are themselves classical, but that the situation is considerably more complicated for subgroups of non-classical Schottky groups.<br /><br />
