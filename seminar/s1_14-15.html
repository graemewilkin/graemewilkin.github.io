<a name="shimada"><b>5 August.</b></a> <font color="green">Ichiro Shimada</font> (Hiroshima University)<br />
<b>Title.</b> K3 surfaces and lattice theory<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> TBA
<br /><br />

<a name="alvarez"><b>13 August.</b></a> <font color="green">Luis Alvarez-Consul</font> (ICMAT, Madrid)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Gravitating vortices and coupled K&auml;hler-Yang-Mills equations<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> After explaining the relation between vortices on a Riemann surface and instantons on a K&auml;hler surface via dimensional reduction, as well as more recent non-abelian generalizations, we go on to study gravitating vortices and their relation to certain coupled equations for K&auml;hler metrics and Yang-Mills connections. Joint work with M. Garcia-Fernandez and O. Garcia-Prada.<br /><br />

<a name="romao"><b>20 August.</b></a> <font color="green">Nuno Rom&atilde;o</font> (G&ouml;ttingen)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Quantum vortices on closed surfaces and \(L^2\)-invariants<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will describe joint work with M. Boekstedt and C. Wegner aiming at uncovering fundamental features of N=(2,2) supersymmetric quantum mechanics on moduli spaces of vortices on compact Riemann surfaces.
My focus in this talk will be on the (topological A-twisted) supersymmetric Abelian Higgs model coupling to local systems, for both linear and nonlinear targets; the corresponding ground states can be investigated by means of the theory of \(L^2\)-invariants applied to the natural K&auml;hler metrics on the universal covers of the moduli spaces. I shall explain why the quanta of such Abelian gauge theories can nontrivially realize non-Abelian statistics in particular examples, and motivate a precise conjecture regarding the nonlinear superposition of ground states for rank one.

<b>Title.</b> Representation varieties in real algebraic geometry<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The GL(n;C) representation variety associated to a compact Riemann surface X has various real structures of interest, the most immediate of which being perhaps that which fixes representations with values in GL(n; R). When the Riemann surface X itself has a real structure, a new real structure of the GL(n;C) representation variety arises, whose fixed points can be interpreted nicely in terms of representations of the fundamental group of X. In this introductory talk, we study in detail that example.

<b>Title.</b> Applications of Algebraic Topology<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We are going to present an overview of persistent homology - a new theory that relates algebraic topology and data analysis. The central idea of algebraic topology is constructing invariants of mathematical objects, like topological spaces, manifolds, links, or even groups in the form of a sequence of groups. We'll show how this approach can be applied to work with data given as a point cloud. The audience is expected to be familiar with basics of topology (topological spaces and continuous maps) and with basics of algebra (groups and homomorphisms), but no deep knowledge of algebraic topology is required to understand the talk and we hope that even undergraduate students are able to follow.<br /><br />

<a name="fei"><b>17 September.</b></a> <font color="green">Hu Fei</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Automorphisms on surfaces and their higher dimensional analogue<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In 2010, Zhang proved that there is some relation between any two automorphisms of positive entropy on a smooth projective surface if both are polarized by the same nonzero nef \(\mathbb{R}\)-divisor. In this talk, we are going to discuss an extension of his result from surfaces to projective hyperk&auml;hler manifolds.<br /><br />

<a name="tuschmann"><b>24 September.</b></a> <font color="green">Wilderich Tuschmann</font> (Karlsruhe Institute of Technology)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Sphere and Stability Theorems for Manifolds with Positive Scalar Curvature<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will discuss several new stabilty results for Riemannian and, in particular, Einstein manifolds with positive scalar curvature.<br />
This is joint work with M. Wiemeler ( KIT).<br /><br />

<a name="pavutnitskiy"><b>8 October.</b></a> <font color="green">Fedor Pavutnitskiy</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Bestvina-Brady groups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In '96 Mladlen Bestvina and Noel Brady constructed a family of subgroups of right-angled Artin groups (so-called graph groups) with a remarkable property: finiteness (F-property) and homological finiteness (FP-property) properties of these groups connected with topological properties of certain flag complexes. This construction gave rise to mutual exclusiveness of the Whitehead conjecture (a subcomplex of an aspherical complex is aspherical) and the Eilenberg-Ganea conjecture (the cohomological dimension of a group is equal to its geometric dimension). We will follow an article from the blog of the Bernstein Seminar on geometric group theory. If time permits, the connection between Bestvina-Brady groups and the plus construction will be discussed.<br /><br />

<a name="shiquan"><b>15 October.</b></a> <font color="green">Ren Shiquan</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> \(k\)-regular mappings<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Let \(X\) be a topological space. A map \(f: X\to\mathbb{R}^N\) is called \(k\)-regular if for any distinct \(x_1,\ldots ,x_k\in X\), \(f(x_1),\ldots, f(x_k)\) are linearly independent. When \(k\geq 2\), a \(k\)-regular map is an embedding. In 1978, some homological methods to study regular embedding problems were invented by F. Cohen and D. Handel. In this presentation, we will discuss some regular embedding problems by applying F. Cohen and D. Handel's methods. <br /><br />

<a name="wang"><b>12 November.</b></a> <font color="green">Bai-Ling Wang</font> (ANU)<br />
<b>Title.</b> \(L^2\)-symplectic vortices and the associated invariants<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will talk about joint work with Bohui Chen on the \(L^2\) moduli spaces of symplectic vortices on Riemann surfaces with cylindrical ends and its associated Gromov-Witten type invariants.<br /><br />
