<b>Title.</b> Algebraic symplectic reduction for the additive group<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Algebraic symplectic reduction is a method for constructing quotients of algebraic group actions on algebraic symplectic varieties, such that the quotients are also algebraic symplectic. We will overview how moment maps and geometric invariant theory for reductive groups is used to perform the reduction, give some examples, and describe how to construct algebraic symplectic analogues of reductive group quotients. Then we describe some new results for the (non-reductive) additive group and explain why this offers greater flexibility than in the reductive group setting.<br /><br />

<a name="mengsheng"><b>19 August.</b></a> <font color="green">Meng Sheng</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Jordan property for non-linear algebraic groups and projective varieties<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> A century ago, Camille Jordan proved that complex general linear group \(GL_n(\mathbb{C})\) has the Jordan property: there is a Jordan constant \(C_n\) such that every finite subgroup \(H \subseteq GL_n(\mathbb{C})\) has an abelian subgroup \(H_1\) of index \([H : H_1] \leq C_n\).  We show that every connected algebraic group \(G\) (which is not necessarily linear) has the Jordan property with the Jordan constant depending only on \(\dim G\), and that the full automorphism group \(Aut(X)\) of every projective variety \(X\) has the Jordan property.<br />This is joint work with Professor De-Qi Zhang.<br /><br />

<a name="graemewilkin"><b>2 September.</b></a> <font color="green">Graeme Wilkin</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Morse theory on singular spaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will explain how to prove the main theorem of Morse theory for a large class of functions on singular spaces. An important example is the norm-square of a moment map on an affine variety, in which case this theorem is a first step in a program to compute topological invariants of symplectic quotients of these spaces. Towards the end of the talk I will present some conjectures in this direction.<br /><br />

<a name="finnurlarusson"><b>16 September.</b></a> <font color="green">Finnur Larusson</font> (University of Adelaide)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Oka theory of affine toric varieties<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Modern Oka theory originated from a 1989 paper of Gromov, one of his many seminal papers.  Over the past 15 years, it has emerged as a subfield of complex analytic geometry in its own right, with a strong connection to homotopy theory.  Oka manifolds are the central objects of this theory.  I will start by explaining what they are.  Then I will talk about recent joint work with Richard Larkang.  We made the first attempt to develop Oka theory for singular spaces, more specifically for affine toric varieties.  We found that if a general Oka theory for singular spaces exists at all, it will have to be much more complicated than the smooth theory.<br /><br />

<a name="graemewilkin2"><b>30 September.</b></a> <font color="green">Graeme Wilkin</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Algebraic classification of Yang-Mills flow lines<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The Yang-Mills equations on a Riemann surface are an example of a PDE which can be studied using methods from algebraic geometry. For example, a theorem of Narasimhan-Seshadri-Donaldson identifies the moduli space of semistable holomorphic bundles with the moduli space of energy-minimising solutions to the Yang-Mills equations. In this talk I will describe how the Yang-Mills flow lines connecting two critical points (defined using analysis) can be classified using the Hecke correspondence (defined using algebraic geometry). There is an analogous picture in the case of the Yang-Mills-Higgs flow, and towards the end of the talk I will describe some links between these results and recent work of Witten.<br /><br />

<a name="fedorpavutnitskiy"><b>14 October.</b></a> <font color="green">Fedor Pavutnitskiy</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Introduction to Goodwillie calculus of functors<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In this talk I want to give some ideas, definitions and properties from functor calculus - machinery of approximation (in "Taylor expansion"-like sense) of various functors arising in topology, by polynomial functors. We will look at two main cases: functor of embeddings of smooth manifolds and homotopy functor calculus. Main results here are computation of homotopy type of space of embeddings and theorem of Arone and Mahowald on derivatives of identity functor \(Top \to Top\), evaluated on 2-local spheres.<br /><br />

<a name="huangruizhi"><b>28 October.</b></a> <font color="green">Huang Ruizhi</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> The classification of rank \(2\) mod \(3\) homotopy associative \(H\)-spaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> A longstanding problem in algebraic topology is to classify finite \(H\)-spaces in integral case or mod \(p\) cases. However, this problem is rather complicated, and only been solved in few cases.<br />
Let \(X\) be a CW-complex with cohomology being an exterior algebra generated by \(r\) elements of odd dimension, we call \(r\) the rank of \(X\). When \(r \leq 2\), the only unsolved case is \(p=3\) which is challengeable and an open question for nearly fifty years. <br />
Here, we consider this problem with an extra homotopy associative condition, and prove that the homotopy type of any rank \(2\) mod \(3\) homotopy associative \(H\)-space is that of some Lie group.<br />
This is a joint work with Prof. Jie Wu.  <br /><br />

<a name="lamsiupor"><b>29 October.</b></a> <font color="green">Lam Siu Por</font> (Capital Normal University, Beijing)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Equivariant K-theory of some finite-dimensional vector spaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Let \(G\) be a compact Lie group with a real representation \(V\). Since equivariant cohomology theories are \(RO(G)\) graded, \(K_G^0(V)\) is part of the ring \(K_G^*(pt)\).<br />
Early computation of \(K_G^0(V)\) goes back to the 60s when Atiyah proved the equivariant Bott periodicity theorem: when the real representation \(V\) admits a \(Spin^c\) structure, then \(K_G^0(V)\) is \(R(G)\) in degree dim(V) mod 2.<br />
There have been many works on the computations of \(K_G^0(V)\) more recently done by Karoubi, Echterhoff and Pfante, and Adem and Gomez amongst others.<br />
We report two results on the value of \(K_G^0(V)\) for two classes of compact Lie groups.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Hyperbolicity and Weil-Petersson geometry of the moduli spaces of certain polarized manifolds<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In this talk, I will talk about some joint work with Sai-Kee Yeung concerning the hyperbolicity properties of the moduli spaces of certain polarized manifolds from the approach of constructing  negatively curved Finsler metrics of Weil-Petersson type.<br /><br />

<a name="alexdimca"><b>9 December.</b></a> <font color="green">Alex Dimca</font> (Nice)<br />
<b>Title.</b> On free and nearly free plane curves.<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We discuss two geometric features of the free and nearly free plane projective curves: the relation with rational cuspidal curves and the maximality of their Tjurina numbers. The case of free surfaces and their relations to homaloidal polynomials will be also briefly discussed.  <br /><br />
