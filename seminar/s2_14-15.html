<a name="stevezucker"><b>15 January.</b></a> <font color="green">Steven Zucker</font> (Johns Hopkins University)<br />
<b>Title.</b>A tale of two Hodge structures<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will talk about the two naturally-defined Hodge structures for the intersection cohomology of the Baily-Borel compactification of a locally symmetric variety.  Are they the same?.<br /><br />

<a name="yihuang"><b>21 January.</b></a> <font color="green">Yi Huang</font> (University of Melbourne)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Crowned hyperbolic surfaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The moduli space of a surface \(R\) parameterizes all the ways that we can build a hyperbolic surface homeomorphic to \(R\). One of last year's Fields medallists - Maryam Mirzakhani - derived a recursion in the (Weil-Petersson) volumes of these moduli spaces and used this recursion to prove the celebrated Witten's conjecture. We give a gentle overview of the key ideas behind her proof, before showing how her work motivates the study of crowned hyperbolic surfaces.<br /><br />

<a name="wangzuoqin"><b>11 February.</b></a> <font color="green">Zuoqin Wang</font> (University of Science and Technology China)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Recovering symmetric potentials of Schrodinger operators<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Given a Schrodinger operator \(\hbar^2 \Delta+V\) on the Euclidean space, or more generally on a Riemannian manifold, a natural question is to what extend does the spectra of this operator determine its potential function, \(V\). We construct various types of spectral invariants and prove that under suitable symmetry assumptions, the potential function is spectrally determined. This is based on joint works with Victor Guillemin (MIT) and Alejandro Uribe (University of Michigan).<br /><br />

<a name="nessimsibony"><b>4 March.</b></a> <font color="green">Nessim Sibony</font> (Orsay)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Parabolic Riemann surfaces and the Green-Griffiths conjecture<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> A conjecture by Green-Griffiths  states  that if X is a projective manifold of general type,  then there exists an algebraic proper subvariety 
of X which contains the image of all holomorphic curves from the complex plane to X.The conjecture is far from being settled. I will question the choice of the complex plane as a source space.<br /> 
Let Y be a parabolic Riemann surface, i.e bounded subharmonic functions defined on Y are constant. The results of Nevanlinna's theory for holomorphic maps f from Y to the projective line are parallel to the classical case when Y is the complex line except for a term involving a weighted Euler characteristic.<br />
Parabolic Riemann Surfaces could be Hyperbolic in the Kobayashi sense.<br /> 
Let X be a manifold of general type, and let A be an ample line bundle on X. It is known that there exists a holomorphic jet differential P (of order k) with values in the dual of A. If the map f has infinite area and if Y has finite Euler characteristic, then  f satisfies the differential relation induced by P.<br /> 
As a consequence, we obtain a generalization of Bloch Theorem concerning the Zariski closure of maps f with values in a complex torus.<br />
We then study the degree of Nevanlinna's current T[f] associated to a parabolic leaf of a foliation F by Riemann surfaces on a compact complex manifold. We show that the degree of T[f] on the tangent bundle of the foliation is bounded from below in terms of the counting function of f with respect to the singularities of F, and the Euler characteristic of Y. In the case of complex surfaces of general type, we obtain a complete analogue of McQuillan's result: a parabolic curve of infinite area and finite Euler characteristic tangent to F is not Zariski dense.That requires some analysis of the dynamics of foliations by Riemann Surfaces.<br />
This is joint work with Mihai Paun.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Exotic components in linear slices of quasi-Fuchsian groups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The linear slice of quasi-Fuchsian punctured torus groups is defined by fixing the length of some simple closed curve to be a fixed positive real number. It is known that the linear slice is a union of disks, and it has one standard component containing Fuchsian groups. Komori-Yamashita proved that there exist non-standard components if the length is sufficiently large. In this talk, I give another proof based on the theory of complex projective structures: roughly, non-standard components come from exotic projective structures with quasi-Fuchsian holonomy.<br /><br />

<a name="hufei"><b>25 March.</b></a> <font color="green">Hu Fei</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Compact K&auml;hler manifolds admitting large solvable groups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Let \(G\) be a group of automorphisms of a compact K&auml;hler manifold \(X\) of dimension \(n\). Suppose \(G\) admits no non-abelian free subgroup, then \(G\) is virtually solvable and there is a finite-index subgroup \(G_1\) of \(G\) such that \(G_1|_{H^{1,1}(X)}\) is solvable and \(Z\)-connected.  Further, the null subset \(N(G_1)\) is a normal subgroup of \(G_1\) and the quotient group \(G_1/N(G_1)\) is a free abelian group of rank at most \(n - 1\).  In this talk, I consider the maximal dynamical rank case (in other words, rank = \(n - 1\)).  We show that in this case, either \(X\) is a complex torus, or \(G\) is virtually a free abelian group of rank \(n - 1\). <br />
This is joint work with Dinh Tien Cuong and Zhang De-Qi.

<b>Title.</b> Jordan Property for Groups of Birational Automorphisms and Automorphisms<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Let \(Bir(X), Aut(X)\) be the birational automorphism group and automorphism group for a smooth projective variety. If \(X\) is non-uniruled, then \(Bir(X)\) is Jordan; assume the BAB conjecture holds, then \(q(X)=0\) can also imply \(Bir(X)\) is Jordan. For the irregular uniruled case, there are examples for \(Bir(X)\) which is not Jordan in any dimension greater than 1, but \(Aut(X)\) is still Jordan for these examples.
