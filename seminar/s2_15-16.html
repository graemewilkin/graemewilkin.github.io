<b>Title.</b> H&ouml;lder singular metrics on big line bundles and equidistribution<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We show that normalized currents of integration along the common zeros of random \(m\)-tuples of powers of \(m\) singular Hermitian big line bundles on a compact K&auml;hler manifold distribute asymptotically to the wedge product of the curvature currents of the metrics. If the Hermitian metrics are H&ouml;lder with singularities we also estimate the speed of convergence.<br />
This is a joint work with Dan Coman and George Marinescu.<br /><br />

<a name="nikolayshcherbina"><b>27 January.</b></a> <font color="green">Nikolay Shcherbina</font> (Wuppertal)<br />
<b>Title.</b> On defining functions for strongly pseudoconvex domains<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We study a question of existence of plurisubharmonic defining functions for unbounded strongly pseudoconvex domains. In particular, we investigate the structure of the set of points where all defining functions fail to be  strictly plurisubharmonic (we call this set the core of a domain). We then investigate properties of the core. Among other results we prove 1-pseudoconcavity of the core, we show that in general the core does not possess an analytic structure, and we investigate Liouville type properties of the core.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Homotopy groups of \(S^3\) bundles over \(S^4\)<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The homotopy, homeomorphism and diffeomorphism types of \(S^3\)-bundles over \(S^4\) have been classified. They depend on the degree four cohomology of the bundle and two other topological invariants. We show that the homotopy groups of the bundle depend only on its degree four cohomology. This is part of a larger programme of determining the homotopy groups of manifolds by considering how their based loop spaces decompose as products of factors.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Palindromic automorphisms of free groups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> An automorphism of a free group is called palindromic if it maps each generator to a palindromic word. The group of all palindromic automorphisms is related to several aspects of topology of free groups. In this talk, we shall introduce this group and duscuss some recent progress.<br /><br />

<a name="billgoldman"><b>22 March.</b></a> <font color="green">Bill Goldman</font> (University of Maryland) <font color="red">(Colloquium talk)</font><br />
<b>Title.</b> Dynamical systems arising from mapping class group actions on moduli spaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The action of the mapping class group action on "character varieties" - moduli spaces of representations of fundamental groups of surfaces - defines interesting dynamical systems. Arising from the classification problem for geometric structures on manifolds, it provides a rich supply of topological invariants as well as new dynamical phenomena.  I will report on joint work with Ser-Peow Tan, George Stantchev and Greg McShane.

<a name="graeme"><b>6 April.</b></a> <font color="green">Graeme Wilkin</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> The Yang-Mills-Higgs flow in the neighbourhood of a critical point<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The Yang-Mills-Higgs flow was originally studied by Simpson in the context of constructing Hermitian-Einstein metrics on Higgs bundles. Methods of Donaldson and Simpson show that the Yang-Mills-Higgs flow resembles a nonlinear heat equation on the space of Hermitian metrics on the bundle and therefore the downwards flow is well-behaved with respect to existence and uniqueness, and it also has nice smoothing properties. On the other hand, the upwards flow is ill-posed and therefore solutions may not exist on a given time interval.<br />
In this talk I will describe how to construct long-time solutions to the upwards Yang-Mills-Higgs flow that converge to a given critical point in the smooth topology on the space of Higgs bundles. On the space of Hermitian metrics, these solutions are asymptotic to a solution of the linear heat equation with initial condition at an eigenfunction of the Laplacian. This gives a criterion for two critical points to be connected by a flow line, and if time permits then I will describe an algebro-geometric interpretation of this criterion.

<b>Title.</b> Exploration on suborbital graphs for various groups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In this talk, we will discuss on the Modular group and generalized Farey Graphs. Suborbital graphs for the Modular group will be introduced and we will extend the construction for the Hecke groups. We will examine some graph properties on the Hecke groups together with the generalized Hecke groups. In particular, we give necessary and sufficient conditions for a suborbital graph to be a forest.

<a name="chrishacon"><b>4 July.</b></a> <font color="green">Christopher Hacon</font> (University of Utah)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Generic vanishing and birational geometry in char p>0<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Many precise results on the birational geometry of irregular varieties have been obtained by combining the generic vanishing theorems of Green and Lazarsfeld  with the Fourier-Mukai transform. In this talk we will discuss the failure of the generic vanishing theorems  in positive characteristic. We will then explain a different approach to generic vanishing based on the theory of F-singularities that leads to concrete applications in birational geometry in positive characteristics.
