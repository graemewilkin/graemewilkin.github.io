<b>Title.</b> Asymptotic behaviour of certain families of harmonic bundles on Riemann surfaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Let \((E, \bar{\partial}_A, \theta)\) be a stable Higgs bundle of degree zero on a compact connected Riemann surface. We are interested in the naturally associated family of harmonic bundles \((E, \bar{\partial}_A, t \theta, h_t)\) for \(t > 0\). We discuss two results on the behaviour of \(h_t\) when \(t\) goes to infinity. First, we explain that the Hitchin equation is asymptotically decoupled under some assumption for the Higgs field. We apply it to the study of the so called Hitchin WKB-problem. Second, we show the convergence of the sequence \(h_t\) to a singular flat metric, in the case where the rank of \(E\) is two. We describe the parabolic weights of the limit metric in terms of the Higgs bundle.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Yang-Mills flow in dimension four<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will describe my thesis results on YM flow in the critical dimension, and some generalizations in progress. These include long-time existence near the minimum energy, and smooth convergence to the Uhlenbeck limit in the unobstructed case. I'll then discuss the problem of uniqueness of limits. As for any geometric flow, this is very difficult to establish when singularities are present.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> The Voevodsky motive of the moduli stack of vector bundles<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We start by introducing Voevodsky motives of varieties (and stacks); the guiding principle is that the motive of a variety should encode various cohomology theories as well as algebraic cycles. We give a formula for the (compactly supported) motive of the moduli stack of vector bundles on a curve, which is reminiscent of the Atiyah-Bott description of the cohomology. We sketch the proof which uses a forgetful map from an ind-variety of matrix divisors to the stack of vector bundles and Bialynicki-Birula decompositions of varieties of matrix divisors. This is joint work with Simon Pepin Lehalleur.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Triangulated categories of 1-motivic sheaves<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> It is well known in algebraic geometry that some aspects of the theory of divisors and 0-cycles on a smooth projective variety are controlled by abelian varieties (compact commutative algebraic groups), the Picard variety and the Albanese variety. The basic example is the Jacobian of a Riemann surface. A natural question is then: what are the analogues for singular, non-compact algebraic varieties? for families of such? One more precise formulation of this question leads naturally to triangulated categories of mixed motivic sheaves (after Voevodsky) over general base schemes. We will give an introduction to this theory, to our results on the subcategory of "1-motivic sheaves", and how they relate to more classical constructions of Deligne.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Stability in geometry and geometry of stability<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Stability conditions in algebraic geometry arise from the need to make sense of quotients of group actions on algebraic varieties, as even in the simplest examples the orbit space may not be separated.  They are therefore of fundamental importance in the construction of moduli spaces (of for example coherent sheaves) which often arise as the quotient of a parameter space by a symmetry group.  The first talk will motivate the passage from classical ideas in geometric invariant theory to the notion of a stability condition on a triangulated category, which has recently provided a new perspective on the birational geometry of moduli spaces of coherent sheaves.  In the second talk the space of all stability conditions on a triangulated category will be studied in its own right, with ideas from physics and computable examples suggesting it carries interesting geometric structures.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Topological modeling and analysis of complex data in biomolecules<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The understanding of biomolecular structure, flexibility, function, and dynamics is one of the most challenging tasks in biological science.  We introduce persistent homology for extracting molecular topological fingerprints (MTFs) based on the persistence of molecular topological invariants. MTFs are utilized for protein characterization, identification, and classification. The multidimensional persistent homology is proposed and further used to quantitatively predict the stability of protein folding configurations generated by steered molecular dynamics. An excellent consistence between my persistent homology prediction and molecular dynamics simulation is found. Further, we introduce multiresolution persistent homology to handle complex biomolecular data. The essential idea is to match the resolution with the scale of interest so as to represent large scale datasets with appropriate resolution. By appropriately tuning the resolution of a density function, we are able to focus the topological lens on the scale of interest. The proposed multiresolution topological method has potential applications in arbitrary data sets, such as social networks, biological networks and graphs. Finally, we offer persistent homology based new strategies for topological denoising and for resolving ill-posed inverse problems in Cryo-EM data.<br />

<b>Title.</b> The symmetric commutator quotient groups of links in 3-manifolds and related topics<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We introduce the intersection subgroup of the normal closures of the meridians of \(n\)-links in 3-manifolds and consider the quotient group of the intersection subgroup modular the symmetric commutator subgroup. We show that when the link is strongly nonsplittable and \(n\geq 3\), the difference between the intersection subgroup and symmetric commutator subgroup of the normal closures of the meridians can be measured by the \(n\)th homotopy groups of the 3-manifold. This might be of particular interesting when the links are lying in the 3-sphere. Some other related topics will be discussed.<br />

<b>Title.</b> W-algebras and Higher Geometric Langlands Correspondence from M-Theory<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will present an M-theoretic derivation of identities between the ordinary, q-deformed and elliptic affine W-algebras first formulated by Feigin-Frenkel-Reshetikhin. As an offshoot, I will demonstrate the sought-after connection between the 4d gauge-theoretic realization of the geometric Langlands correspondence by Kapustin-Witten and its algebraic CFT formulation by Beilinson-Drinfeld. In turn, I will argue that the higher 5d/6d analog of the geometric Langlands correspondence for simply-laced Lie (Kac-Moody) groups G (G_k), ought to relate the quantization of circle (elliptic)-valued G Hitchin systems to circle/elliptic-valued ^LG (^LG_k)-bundles over a complex curve on one hand, and the representation theory of quantum/elliptic affine (toroidal) G-algebras on the other, where ^LG is the Langlands dual of G.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Complements of homotopy sphere arrangements<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The Brieskorn and Orlik-Solomon theorems state that the cohomology ring of the complement of a complex hyperplane arrangement is isomorphic to the Orlik-Solomon algebra of its intersection lattice. In this talk, I will show that homotopy sphere arrangements arising as homotopy colimits of diagrams of spaces on a geometric lattice can be embedded into topological spheres when the codimension is greater than or equal to two.  This gives a formula for the cohomology groups of the complements of these arrangements and raises a question about the relationship between the cohomology rings of these complements and the Orlik-Solomon algebra of the given lattice.<br />
This is joint work with Alex Engstr&ouml;m.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Exponential growth of homotopy groups of suspended finite complexes<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We study the asymptotic behavior of the homotopy groups of simply connected finite \(p\)-local complexes, and define a space to be locally hyperbolic if its homotopy groups have exponential growth. Under some certain conditions related to the functorial decomposition of loop suspension, we prove that the suspended finite complexes are locally hyperbolic if suitable information of the homotopy groups is known. In particular, we prove that Moore spaces are locally hyperbolic, and other candidates are also given. In contrast, we also prove that the homotopy groups of finite complexes have at most exponential growth. <br />

<b>Title.</b> Simplicial James-Hopf map and the action on Curtis spectral sequence<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will construct an extension of the classical James-Hopf map for the James construction to simplicial group setting. Some properties and connections with various areas of algebra and topology will be discussed. Such extension preserves lower central series filtration on the simplicial group and gives a map between corresponding spectral sequences. If time permits, decomposition of Curtis spectral sequence will be shown.<br />
