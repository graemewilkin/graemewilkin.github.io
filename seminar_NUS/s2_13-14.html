<h2 align="left">Abstracts</h2>

<a name="five"><b>7 February.</b></a> <font color="green">Jungkai Chen</font> (National Taiwan University)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Geography of varieties of general type<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In classification theory of algebraic varieties, we are interested in the distribution of birational invariants of varieties, such as genus, volume and Euler characteristic. A priori, these invariants could be arbitrarily large. However, they satisfy the famous Miyaoka-Yau Inequality and Noether Inequality in dimension 2. In this talk, we will explore the three dimensional analogue of these inequalities. <br /><br />

<a name="seven"><b>19 February.</b></a> <font color="green">Emma Carberry</font> (University of Sydney)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Harmonic maps, Toda frames and extended Dynkin diagrams<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I shall discuss harmonic maps from surfaces into homogeneous spaces \(G/T\) where  \(G\) is any simple real Lie group (not necessarily compact) and \(T\) is a Cartan subgroup. All immersions of a genus one surface into \(G/T\) possessing a Toda frame can be constructed by integrating a pair of commuting vector fields on a finite dimensional  subspace of a loop algebra. I will provide necessary and sufficient  conditions for the existence of a Toda frame and describe those \(G/T\) to which the theory applies in terms of involutions of  extended Dynkin diagrams. Applications will be given to harmonic maps into de Sitter spaces and to Willmore tori in \(S^3\). <br /><br />

<a name="eight"><b>26 February.</b></a> <font color="green">Changho Keem</font>  (Seoul National University)<br />
<b>Title.</b> On Weierstrass points on curves of low genus<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> On an algebraic curve of genus more than one, there are so-called Weierstrass points which are rather distinguished points on the given curve. After reviewing some basic notions and several known results in the Weierstrass point business, we will focus on  curves of low genus, say g=3, 4, 5. Especially we are particularly interested in those curves with Weierstrass points of maximal possible weights.  <br /><br />

<a name="ten"><b>12 March.</b></a> <font color="green">Wu Jie</font> (NUS)<br />
<b>Title.</b> The chromatic polynomials and configuration spaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We will talk about some connections between chromatic polynomials and configuration spaces. This talk will be given in a flexible way with reporting our very limited preliminary progress on the connections between topology and combinatorics, as what it is proposed for having more potential interplay between pure mathematics and applied mathematics. The talk will of course aim to general audience. <br /><br />

<a name="twelve"><b>20 March.</b></a> <font color="green">Mathai Varghese</font> (University of Adelaide)<br />
<b>Title.</b> T-duality - topology change in spacetime in the presence of a background flux<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will explain a geometric approach to T-duality, which is a fundamental symmetry of String Theory. In the presence of a background "H-flux", I will show that T-duality implies that String Theory on topologically different spacetimes can be equivalent!<br />
(A background in differential forms and undergraduate topology will be useful for the talk.)
 <br /><br />

<a name="sixteen"><b>16 April.</b></a> <font color="green">Matthew Young</font> (University of Hong Kong)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Self-dual quiver moduli and counting invariants<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In this talk I will discuss some recent work on moduli spaces of self-dual quiver representations. These spaces are analogues of moduli spaces of principal bundles over curves with classical structure groups. I will also discuss some applications to counting invariants, wall-crossing formulas and quantum dilogarithm identities.
 <br /><br />

<a name="seventeen"><b>23 April.</b></a> <font color="green">Caucher Birkar</font> (Cambridge University)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Birational algebraic geometry<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In this talk I will try to explain some of the basic notions and ideas of modern birational classification of algebraic varieties. This topic is closely related to complex analytic geometry, topology, and arithmetic geometry.
<br /><br />

<a name="eighteen"><b>25 April.</b></a> <font color="green">Pedram Hekmati</font> (University of Adelaide)<br />
<b>Title.</b> T-duality Transform of String Structures<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> T-duality is a differential geometric version of the Fourier-Mukai transform, which relates topologically distinct torus bundles and interchanges geometric structures on them. String structures are higher analogues of spin structures and are closely related to the existence of a Dirac operator on loop spaces. The aim of this talk is to explain how string structures behave under T-duality and the implications for so called heterotic string theories. <br />
This is joint work with David Baraglia.<br />
