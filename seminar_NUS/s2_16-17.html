<b>Title.</b> Dynamical degrees, Weil's Riemann hypothesis and the standard conjecture D<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Let \(X\) be a smooth projective variety over an algebraically closed field of arbitrary characteristic, and \(f:X \rightarrow X\) a dominant regular morphism. In this talk, using consequences of Deligne's proof of Weil's Riemann hypothesis, I show that two notions of entropy associated to f, one defined using algebraic cycles and the other one defined using l-adic cohomology groups, coincide. This answers affirmatively a question posed by Esnault and Srinivas. More general results are proven if the Fundamental Conjecture D (numerical vs homological equivalence) holds. I will also discuss how simple proofs of Weil's Riemann hypothesis follow if some results in complex dynamics extend to positive characteristics.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> On the equivalence between Bowditch's Q-condition and primitive stable condition<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The group \(Out(\mathbb{F}_2)\) of outer-automorphisms of rank 2 free group \(\mathbb{F}_2\) acts naturally on the \(PSL(2,\mathbb{C})\)-character variety of \(\mathbb{F}_2\). To study the dynamical property of this action, Bowditch's Q-condition and the primitive stable condition on a representation from \(\mathbb{F}_2\) to \(PSL(2,\mathbb{C})\) have been introduced by Bowditch (generalized by Tan-Wong-Zhang) and by Minsky, respectively. Each one of them can characterize an open subset of the character variety on which \(Out(\mathbb{F}_2)\) acts properly discontinuously. In particular, they both strictly contain discrete, faithful and geometrically finite representations. In our work, we are interested in comparing these two conditions and we show that they are equivalent to each other. In this talk, I will first recall the definitions of the two conditions and some previous study on them. Then I will give a sketch of the proof of the main result.<br />
This is joint work with Jaejeong Lee.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Skein algebras of surfaces and Quantum Teichm&uuml;ller space<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We show how to decompose the Kauffman bracket skein algebra of a surface, which is a quantized version of the character variety, into elementary blocks corresponding to the triangles in an ideal triangulation of the surface.  We also explain the relation between the Kauffman bracket skein algebra and the quantum Teichm&uuml;ller space.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> On a problem of B. Mazur and the density of rational points on Abelian varieties<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> A question raised by  B. Mazur suggests the following conjecture:<br />
Let \(A\) be a simple Abelian variety defined over a real number field \(K\). Denote by \(A(\mathbb{R})\) the Lie group of its real points and by \(A(\mathbb{R})^0\) the connected component of the origin. Then the group  \(\mathbb{Z} P\) generated by any point \(P\) of infinite order in \(A(K)\cap A(\mathbb{R})^0\) is dense in \(A(\mathbb{R})^0\). <br />

Transcendence methods yield weaker statements like the following: <i>Let \(A\) be a simple Abelian variety of dimension \(d\) defined over a number field \(K\) embedded in \(\mathbb{R}\). Let \(\Gamma\) be a subgroup of \(A(K)\cap A(\mathbb{R})^0\) of rank \(\geq d^2-d+1\). Then \(\Gamma\) is dense in \(A(\mathbb{R})^0\)</i>.<br />

Some results can also be obtained on the density in \(A(\mathbb{C})\) of  subgroups of \(A(K)\), when \(K\) is any number field embedded into the field \(\mathbb{C}\) of complex numbers.

<b>Title.</b> Hyperbolic jigsaws and families of pseudomodular surfaces<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> A pseudomodular group is a Fuchsian group which is not commensurable with the modular group but which has cusp set all of the rationals. The corresponding surface is called a pseudomodular surface. We show that there are infinitely many commensurability classes of pseudomodular groups/surfaces, thus answering a question raised by Long and Reid. We do this by introducing a general construction of surfaces whose fundamental domains are obtained by gluing together marked ideal triangular tiles, which we call hyperbolic jigsaw surfaces.<br />
This is joint work with Beicheng Lou and Anh Duc Vo.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Supersymmetric Path Integral and Chern Character<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The work of Witten, Alvarez-Gaume, Atiyah and Bismut reveals how the celebrated Atiyah-Singer index theorem can be formally derived from supersymmetric path integral, more precisely, integral over super loop space. The Chern character, the fundamental functor from K theory to cohomology, appears in the Atiyah-Singer index theorem. In this talk, we will show that led by the supersymmetric path integral quantisation and the Stolz-Teichner program about supersymmetric QFT, the Chern characters (ordinary, equivariant and twisted) can be identified with various super holonomy in gauge theory or dimension reduction functor for QFT. <br />
These represent our joint work with Daniel Berwick-Evans and with Varghese Mathai.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Equivariant Homological Mirror Symmetry from Open Gauged String Theory<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> We describe an equivariant version of homological mirror symmetry as suggested by open gauged string theory. In particular, we describe, for toric manifolds, the objects in the equivariant Fukaya and derived category realized by equivariant A and B-branes in open gauged string theory, respectively, and their mirrors. We also describe the open Hamiltonian Gromov-Witten invariants realized by string scattering amplitudes, and discuss the obstruction to defining the vortex Floer cohomology group for a pair of intersecting G-invariant Lagrangian submanifolds which is intimately related to the phenomenon of supersymmetry-breaking in the physical theory.<br /><br />

<a name="matthewkleban"><b>15 March.</b></a> <font color="green">Matthew Kleban</font> (NYU)<br />
<b>Title.</b> Inhomogeneous Anisotropic Cosmology<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> "To justify my own existence, I'm always claiming that the topology of the universe is important. It's actually true!"  (A certain professor of mathematics and low-dimensional topologist, after reading my paper.) <br />
Are you interested in learning about an application of cutting-edge pure mathematics to the ultimate fate of the universe?  In this talk I will prove that the spatial topology of our universe strongly constrains its future - for "most" spatial topologies and with matter satisfying the weak energy condition,  Einstein's general relativity equations require that the universe must expand forever at least somewhere, regardless of the formation of black holes and other strongly non-linear gravitational effects.  Only for spherical topologies can the entire universe recollapse to a "big crunch" singularity.  Furthermore, in the presence of a positive cosmological constant (or suitable inflationary potential) there must always be part of the universe that expands at least as fast as de Sitter spacetime.  These results make use of very modern mathematics, including Perelman's proof of the Poincare conjecture and the technique of "mean curvature flow".

<b>Title.</b> 3-Manifold invariants derived from the intersecting kernels of Heegaard splittings<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The intersecting kernel of a Heegaard splitting \(H_1 \cup_S H_2\) for a compact orientable 3-manifold \(M\) is the subgroup \(K=\text{Ker} ({i_1}_*)\cap \text{Ker} ({i_2}_*)\)  of \(\pi_1(S)\), where \({i_j}_*:\pi_1(S)\rightarrow\pi_1(H_{j})\) is the homomorphism induced by the inclusion \(i_{j}:S\hookrightarrow H_{j}\), \(j=1,2\). In the talk, I will desccribe some invariants of 3-manifolds \(M\) from certain quotient groups of the intersecting kernels of their Heegaard splittings.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Chaotic actions of topological semigroups<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Bob Devaney defines a dynamical system (generated by a map or a differential equation) to be chaotic if (a) it is topologically transitive, (b) if the periodic points are dense and (c) if it has sensitive dependence on initial conditions. We extend Devaney's notion of chaos to the context of continuous actions of topological semigroups. A well-known result of Banks et al. [1] shows that the condition (c) of being sensitive to initial conditions is redundant. We generalize this result to chaotic actions of topological semigroups [2].<br />
This is joint work with Friedrich M. Schneider, Sebastian Kerkhoff and Mike Behrisch. <br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> A geometric approach to the non-abelian Reidemeister torsion of hyperbolic 3-manifolds<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The non-abelian Reidemeister torsion of a finite volume hyperbolic 3-manifold with cusps is a numerical invariant defined in terms of the monodromy representation of the hyperbolic structure. A generalization of the Volume Conjecture predicts that the torsion determines the sub-leading coefficient in the asymptotic expansion of the Kashaev invariant when the cusped manifold is the complement of a hyperbolic knot. Using methods and insights of mathematical physics, a new conjectural formula for the torsion has been derived by Dimofte-Garoufalidis, expressing the torsion directly in terms of the combinatorics of Thurston's gluing equations and their shape parameter solution. By linking the original definition of the non-abelian torsion to the deformation theory of hyperbolic structures, we show that the conjectural formula is correct up to a monic monomial in the shape parameters.<br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Inertia Groupoids and their singularity structure or why we need a concept of stratified groupoids<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The inertia space of a compact Lie group action or more generally of a proper Lie groupoid has an interesting singularity structure. Unlike the quotient space of the group action, respectively the groupoid, the inertia space can not be stratified by orbit types, in general. In the talk we explain this phenomenon and provide a stratification and local description of the inertia space. Moreover, we show that that leads naturally to the concept of a stratified groupoid which lies in between the one of a Lie groupoid and the one of a topological groupoid. Finally we show that a de Rham theorem holds for inertia spaces and explain the connection of the inertia space with the non-commutative geometry of the underlying groupoid.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Irreducible representations with non-central centralizers and singular points on character varieties<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> In general linear groups, Schur's lemma forces all irreducible representations from any finitely generated group to be centralized only by central elements (scalar matrices). However, in other reductive groups there are examples of irreducible representations with non-central centralizers. In this talk, we will see various examples of such representations and relate this to the notion of algebraic singularity on character varieties.<br />

<b>Title.</b> Motivic Theories and &Eacute;tale Cohomology<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Suppose that \(E\) is an invariant of smooth \(k\)-varieties, by this we mean a functor from the opposite category of smooth \(k\)-varieties into spectra/chain complexes satisfying \(\mathbb{A}^1\)-invariance and a Mayer-Vietoris property (much like a generalized cohomology theory in topology!). Examples of these include algebraic \(K\)-theory, motivic cohomology and algebraic cobordism. We ask: how far away is this functor from satisfying &eacute;tale descent? Concretely, if \(\text{Spec}\,L \rightarrow \text{Spec}\,k\) is a Galois extension of fields, how do we compute the value \(E(k)\) from knowledge of \(E(L)\)? <br />

This question was addressed by Thomason in 1985 for (mod n) algebraic \(K\)-theory and the answer yielded (among other profits) a proof of Grothendieck's absolute purity conjecture for \(\ell\)-adic cohomology.<br />

In joint with work Paul Arne &Oslash;stv&aelig;r, we address this question for a larger class of invariants, uniformly, and using a different method - Voevodsky's slice filtration on the category of motivic spectra. I will explain this method, as well as provide a gentle introduction to the requisite motivic homotopy theory required to set it up - only rudiments of stable homotopy theory and algebraic geometry will be assumed.

<b>Title.</b> Entropy of embedded surfaces in Quasi-Fuchsian manifolds<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The entropy is a dynamical invariant which measures the volume growth rate of balls in the universal cover of a manifold. For compact manifolds it is equal to the critical exponent, which is defined via the action of the  fundamental group  on the universal cover. These invariants have been extensively studied for various classes of manifolds. For example, a well-known theorem of A. Katok said that the entropy of a compact surface is minimal when the metric is hyperbolic, among all metrics of same volume.<br />
We will restrict our analysis to quasi-Fuchsian manifolds, these are  hyperbolic 3-manifolds whose limit set is a Jordan curve. A  theorem of R. Bowen said that the critical exponent of such a manifold reaches its minimum on the Fuchsian locus, that is when the limit set is a circle.<br />
Our aim is, in some sort, to combine these two results, and try to understand how entropy of surfaces behaves in the class of embedded surfaces in a quasi-Fuchsian manifold. More precisely we will show there is a gap between the maximum of entropy among every negatively curved surface and the critical exponent of the group acting on \(\mathbb{H}^3\).

<b>Title.</b> Homotopy theory of complete Lie algebras<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> Having as motivation the Deligne's principle by which every deformation functor is governed by a differential graded Lie algebra, we build a homotopy theory for these algebras which extend the classical Quillen approach. This let us model any (non necessarily 1-connected nor path connected) topological space. <br />

<b>Title.</b> Prescribing capacitary curvature measures on planar convex domains<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> For \(p\) in the interval \((1,2]\) and a bounded, convex, nonempty, open set \(D\) in the plane let \(m(p,D,\cdot)\) be the p-capacitary curvature measure on the unit circle \(T\). This talk will show that such a problem of prescribing \(m(p,D,\cdot)\) on a planar convex domain: "Given a finite, nonnegative, Borel measure \(m\) on \(T\), find a bounded, convex, nonempty, open set \(D\) in the plane such that \(m(p,D,\cdot)=m(\cdot)\)" is solvable if and only if  \(m\) has centroid at the origin and its support does not comprise any pair of antipodal points. And, the solution is unique up to translation. Moreover, if \(m(p,\cdot)=f(\cdot)ds\) with \(f \in C^{k,a}\) and \(ds\) being the standard arc-length element on \(T\), then the boundary of \(D\)  is of \(C^{k+2,a}\). <br /><br />

<b>Title.</b> Stability conditions and Fourier-Mukai theory on abelian threefolds<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> The notion of Fourier-Mukai transform for abelian varieties was introduced by Mukai in early 1980s. Since then Fourier-Mukai theory turned out to be extremely successful in studying stable sheaves and complexes of them, and also their moduli spaces. I will explain how the Fourier-Mukai techniques are useful to show that the conjectural construction proposed by Bayer, Macri and Toda gives rise to Bridgeland stability conditions on abelian threefolds. First we reduce the requirement of the Bogomolov-Gieseker type inequalities to a smaller class of tilt stable objects which are essentially minimal objects of the conjectural stability condition hearts for a given smooth projective threefold. Then we establish the existence of Bogomolov-Gieseker type inequalities for these minimal objects of abelian threefolds by showing certain Fourier-Mukai transforms give equivalences of abelian categories which are double tilts of coherent sheaves.<br />

<b>Title.</b> The Riemann-Hilbert problem for period integrals - recent applications<br />
<b>Abstract.</b> I will discuss two recent applications of the Riemann-Hilbert problem for periods of CY manifolds. One of them deals with the hyperplane conjecture for toric hypersurfaces that goes back to the mid 1990's. The second application provide descriptions for zeros of derivatives of generalized hypergeometric functions.<br />
The lecture is based on joint work with A. Huang, S.-T. Yau and M. Zhu. <br />
